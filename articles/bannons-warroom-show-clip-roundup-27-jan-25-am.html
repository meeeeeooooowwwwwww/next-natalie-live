    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 27 Jan 25 [AM]</h1>
    <div>Steve Bannon and Ben Bergquam’s discussion highlights the challenges of deporting illegal immigrants from sanctuary cities like Chicago, where local and state officials refuse to cooperate with ICE. Bannon referenced past successes under Trump, urging immediate action to address Central American countries’ responses and Columbia’s ongoing negotiations. Bergquam, reporting from Chicago, described the obstacles ICE faces in deporting criminal aliens due to state and city policies that block ICE detainers. These policies force ICE to track down dangerous individuals in communities, creating risks for agents and the public. Bannon criticized officials like Chicago’s mayor and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker for enabling lawlessness by releasing criminal aliens back into communities. Bergquam noted that ICE agents were shocked by the severity of the situation, with hundreds of detainees being held but not released to ICE. Both predicted federal actions, including potential defunding of sanctuary cities, as a response. Bannon called for stronger enforcement and a crackdown on uncooperative officials, arguing that public safety and national security demand immediate action. Bergquam shared firsthand experiences of ICE operations, highlighting bureaucratic hurdles and the urgent need for systemic reform to address what they see as deliberate obstruction of immigration enforcement. Part One:  Part Two:  Steve Bannon and Ben Bergquam discussed the ongoing detention of Tyler Burleson, who remains in Unicoi County Jail without being arraigned for over a week. Burleson, allegedly held on to an insufficient check charge, revealed that the business involved wasn’t pressing charges and that the check was resolved before his arrest. He claims his detention stems from local authorities targeting him, notably after he opened a community distribution center without seeking permission. Burleson accused Detective Tony Buchanan and D.A. Justin Iraq of unjust actions, alleging personal bias and a deliberate effort to keep him jailed. He also stated that Mayor Glenn White opposed the distribution center, reflecting tensions between his efforts to aid the community and local government officials. Burleson expressed frustration at being cut off from outside communication and having limited access to visitation or updates. Bannon pledged to investigate the situation and spotlight the authorities involved, suggesting political motivations behind the arrest. The conversation emphasized Burleson’s belief that his detention is an attempt to suppress his work and keep him from supporting President Trump during his recent visit to the region. Bannon and Bergquam vowed to seek justice and accountability.  Eli Crane joined Steve Bannon to discuss the reconciliation process and its challenges. Crane expressed concern over the Republican conference’s preference for a single comprehensive bill, which he believes is risky and inefficient. He emphasized the need for immediate wins, mainly to fund Tom Homan and border security efforts, as delays could lead to more American lives being lost due to illegal immigration. Crane highlighted the logistical difficulties of passing a single massive bill, which would allow the mainstream media to push anti-deportation narratives, weaken moderate Republicans, and stall meaningful border security and deportation measures. Bannon supported Crane’s argument, pointing out that the complexity of a hefty bill would delay progress until mid-2024, leaving immigration reform vulnerable to opposition from the media, deep state, and administrative state. He criticized the lack of preparation for a two-bill approach and warned that the one-bill strategy would give adversaries time to undermine Trump’s immigration agenda. Crane and Bannon agreed that the deep state and administrative state are actively resisting Trump’s plans, including funding for deportation efforts. They noted that ICE agents could become targets of media campaigns designed to generate emotional backlash, which would pressure moderate Republicans to withdraw support. Additionally, Crane addressed the broader fiscal challenges, including looming government shutdowns and deficits. He criticized proposals like the Freedom Caucus’ plan to increase the debt ceiling by $4 trillion over two years, signaling two trillion-dollar annual deficits. Both Crane and Bannon stressed the importance of Republicans standing firm on fiscal discipline while ensuring Trump receives the resources necessary for border security and deportations.  Mercedes Schlapp joined Steve Bannon on War Room to emphasize the importance of the upcoming CPAC conference at National Harbor. Schlapp described CPAC as the premier gathering for conservatives, offering Americans and international leaders a platform to unite, strategize, and celebrate President Trump’s victories. Schlapp highlighted CPAC’s global reach, noting its influence in countries like Argentina, Japan, Brazil, and Australia, where it supports conservative movements against communism and globalism. She explained how these nations are inspired by Trump’s leadership and seek to replicate his America First policies in their own regions. This year’s CPAC theme, "America is Winning,” is about the urgency of implementing Trump’s agenda quickly. Schlapp stressed that conservatives must stay focused and act decisively to overcome opposition from legacy media and reorganize Democrats. With tickets priced at $76 using the promo code "WarRoom,” CPAC aims to attract a massive turnout. Schlapp called it a chance to celebrate victories and prepare for upcoming battles at the local, state, and federal levels. She encouraged all patriots to join this critical event and play a role in shaping the future.  Steve Bannon and Marc Beckman, an NYU professor and author on AI, discussed the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and its implications. Bannon expressed skepticism about the growing influence of Chinese technology, particularly DeepSeek, a new AI app gaining popularity in the U.S. He warned that, like TikTok, it could collect massive amounts of data from users, raising concerns about privacy and security. Beckman acknowledged these risks but pointed out that DeepSeek is a sophisticated tool, and the Chinese government’s investment in AI could outpace U.S. efforts. He also highlighted the growing use of AI in cyber attacks, particularly from China, targeting U.S. infrastructure. While Beckman expressed optimism about AI’s potential, especially in fields like fashion, finance, and military, he also shared concerns about its dangers, such as privacy violations and the increasing use of facial recognition technology. His book, Some Future Day, aims to help readers leverage AI for career advancement but also addresses these risks. Bannon, ever cautious, questioned the long-term effects of letting foreign powers control such technology. Beckman also discussed the real-world applications of AI, noting its growing presence in various industries while emphasizing the need for safe, responsible development.   Joe Allen and Steve Bannon discuss the intersection of technology, AI, and the future of global power, focusing on the potential threat China poses. Allen acknowledges the complex nature of the situation, describing the recent rise of the Chinese company DeepSeek’s AI model, which has been open-sourced and quickly adopted by American users, resulting in sensitive data being sent to Chinese servers. Bannon warns that this represents a significant challenge to American tech dominance compared to TikTok’s impact. The conversation turns to the energy demands of AI, particularly regarding large-scale models, and the shift in priorities where the focus has moved away from climate change to securing massive energy supplies to drive technological advances. Allen and Bannon agree that this moment is a hybrid of a "Sputnik moment” and a psyop, with China leveraging its AI advancements to assert dominance while manipulating global perceptions. They also discuss the accelerating race to develop AI, spurred by competition between U.S. and Chinese tech leaders. While some American tech figures push for rapid AI development, the conversation reflects deep concerns over data security, the broader geopolitical struggle, and the potential societal consequences of AI’s unchecked growth.  Steve Bannon and Maureen Bannon discuss exciting details about upcoming events, including the CPAC conference and the Force Multiplier Academy, which will take place at the Gaylord National Harbor on February 19. Steve invites War Room Posse members to attend, offering an exclusive discounted CPAC ticket at $76 (normally $95). To attend the Force Multiplier Academy, attendees must have a valid CPAC ticket. The academy promises impactful speakers and sessions, with updates on room details to be shared soon. Steve encourages participation, highlighting the presence of key speakers and War Room’s active role in the event. They also mention Real America’s Voice, which will provide extensive coverage, including appearances by notable figures like John Solomon and Natalie Winters. Steve shares the ambition of making the event accessible and encourages the audience to attend both CPAC and the Force Multiplier Academy. He also emphasizes the importance of supporting War Room by sharing content, signing up for free resources, and engaging with sponsors, whom they’ve chosen for their valuable information and relationship-building. Steve reiterates War Room’s commitment to remaining free of paywalls and making content widely available to reach the American public. He concludes by urging listeners to secure their CPAC tickets via cpac.org and register for the Force Multiplier Academy at the provided event link. </div>
