    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 7/2/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>In their conversation, Matthew Whitaker and Dave Brat discuss the current state of the Department of Justice (DOJ) under Attorney General Merrick Garland, contrasting it with Whitaker’s tenure during the Trump administration. Whitaker highlights that during his time at the DOJ, justice was applied evenly, following the Constitution and the rule of law without political bias. He criticizes Garland for allegedly targeting individuals supportive of Trump, like Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon, and for the perceived selective application of the law. Whitaker emphasizes that the Supreme Court has recently upheld the rule of law, citing a significant opinion on the separation of powers and presidential immunity. He underscores the importance of this ruling for sustaining the constitutional republic. Whitaker also discusses how, under Trump’s administration, the DOJ focused on border security and reducing violent crime, claiming these efforts were effective. Brat asks Whitaker for examples of the DOJ’s impartiality under Trump, to which Whitaker responds by mentioning the handling of the Mueller investigation and how it concluded without politicization. Whitaker believes that current DOJ actions are politically motivated, using novel legal theories against Trump and his allies. They also touch on the Supreme Court’s recent decisions, including the overturning of the Chevron deference and the affirmation of presidential immunity for official acts. Whitaker argues that the left’s reaction to the immunity ruling is exaggerated, as this principle has been long-standing in U.S. history. Whitaker concludes by noting that recent Supreme Court decisions will impact ongoing cases against Trump, potentially leading to re-evaluation of evidence and delays in proceedings. Brat commends Whitaker’s clear and rational explanations of these complex legal and constitutional issues.  Scott Presler and Natalie Winters discuss the significant political shifts in Pennsylvania, highlighting Presler’s grassroots efforts and voter registration successes. Presler shares impressive statistics, noting that the Democratic voter advantage has shrunk from 595,000 to 75,000 in two years. This progress is attributed to a focused outreach to various demographic groups, including Amish, truckers, hunters, and young men. Presler emphasizes the importance of targeting communities like the Amish, hunters, and truckers and details efforts to engage these groups through events and direct interactions. He also mentions the increasing support among young men, mainly black and Hispanic males, and Jewish community members following recent political developments. Winters and Presler also discuss the impact of the recent presidential debate on public opinion. Many voters perceive President Biden as unfit and President Trump as presidential. Presler believes this perception shift is reflected in voter registration trends and polling data. Presler encourages active political involvement, urging people to download the Early Vote Action app to participate in voter registration efforts and volunteer as election day workers. He stresses the importance of having election day workers to ensure election integrity, especially in states with extended early voting periods.  Natalie Winters and Savannah Hernandez discuss a shocking incident in San Francisco during a Pride event. Hernandez describes witnessing fully naked men, public sex acts, and urination in front of children, with police officers not intervening. She highlights the double standards in law enforcement, contrasting the lack of action in San Francisco with the severe penalties faced by those who damage pride flags or political figures like Steve Bannon. Hernandez expresses concern over the exposure of such acts to children and criticizes the Biden administration for supporting these events. Winters and Hernandez both criticize the mainstream Democratic Party for pushing these values in classrooms and fear these behaviors will be normalized in educational materials. Hernandez also points out that public nudity, which was banned in 2012, is permitted during such events with city approval.  In their conversation, Dave Brat and Ben Harnwell discussed a significant conference held at the Vatican a decade ago, focusing on wealth creation from a Christian perspective. Ben organized the meeting to counter the Marxist undertones in Pope Francis’s pontificate. They highlighted Steve Bannon’s involvement in the conference and his prescient views on global populist movements, issues like Islam, Russia, and economic policies. They also touched on Bannon’s advocacy for Judeo-Christian values and critiques of socialism. Their dialogue underscored themes of moral foundations in Western civilization and critiques of historical mischaracterizations of fascism and socialism.  Steve Bannon’s intense interview with Vaughn Hillyard on MSNBC before he surrendered to the Danbury Correctional facility on Monday delved into various contentious issues. Bannon criticized MSNBC’s coverage of executive power, arguing against expanded surveillance measures and emphasizing recent legal setbacks for executive authority. He defended his actions during the January 6th committee investigation, asserting his adherence to legal strategies to contest election results. Bannon accused MSNBC of bias and collaboration with the Justice Department, highlighting perceived injustices and calling for investigations into alleged abuses of power. He outlined his priorities for the future, including immigration policy reform, fiscal conservatism, and ending military engagements abroad. Bannon’s determined defense of himself, President Trump, and the MAGA movement underscored his ongoing influence within the MAGA movement and his commitment to challenging establishment norms. The interview highlighted deep divisions over constitutional interpretations and the role of media in shaping public discourse on political issues. </div>
