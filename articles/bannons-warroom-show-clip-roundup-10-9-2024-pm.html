    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 10/9/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Natalie Winters talks about what she calls the Deep State and their weaponization of government tactics.  Mike Davis talked about his experience working on the US Supreme Court nomination process, specifically during the time of Brett Kavanagh. He pointed out that a recent investigation into Kavanagh, based on Sheldon Whitehouse, is the corporate media spreading misinformation and using lawfare tactics against Kavanagh.  Davis reminds the WarRoom audience that at the time of Kvanagh’s nomination, Davis released a list of things that the Senate could have investigated with Senate investigators and chose not to follow up on.  Liz Harrington told us about the latest developments in Georgia regarding the 2020 election and how fraud and corruption were detected there.   Patty McMurray talked about the importance of a lawsuit aimed at halting the counting of overseas ballots in Michigan, where voters do not have to prove residency or citizenship. She explains that the Michigan GOP and RNC filed this lawsuit against Michigan Secretary of State Jasmine Benson and her Director of Elections, Jonathan Breeder, for giving clerks guidance that allows overseas voters, registered under the UOCAVA designation, to vote without proving they lived in Michigan or the U.S. Some overseas voters, Patty claims, may never have resided in Michigan or the U.S., and yet ballots are distributed to them via email. She notes a significant increase in overseas ballots in 2020, which is not widely reported except by The Gateway Pundit, and expresses frustration over the situation.  Natalie Winters talked about a recent interview of Kamala Harris.  Sam Faddis reviewed Vice President candidate Tim Walz’s numerous connections with the Chinese Communist Party.  Grace Chong revised the final dates for registering to vote. She promoted JoJo’s position of answering questions by email regarding getting out the vote for the Trump campaign. Chong said that JoJo had reported getting many emails asking how to get active for the second day.  In a discussion between Dr. Bradley Thayer and Capt. Jim Fanell, they address increasing threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the Indo-Pacific region under the Biden administration. Col. Fanell highlights key points such as China’s intercontinental ballistic missile test, its aggressive military activities, and its expanding naval presence. These actions, including incursions near Taiwan, Japan, and the Philippines, indicate China’s growing ambition to displace U.S. influence and dominate the region. He also points out strategic losses like the potential turnover of Diego Garcia, which compromises U.S. security. Fanell underscores that these developments significantly degraded national security compared to the Trump era, where the Indo-Pacific was more stable. He emphasizes that China is practicing to strike the U.S. with nuclear weapons and notes their increasing aggression toward Taiwan, Japan, and other U.S. allies. The conversation also touches on the geopolitical importance of Taiwan, especially in the context of chip production and political symbolism. They conclude that China’s actions, including military provocations and political warfare, are part of a broader strategy that is likely to intensify before the U.S. elections, reflecting the CCP’s desire to influence global politics. </div>
