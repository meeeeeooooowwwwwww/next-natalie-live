    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 5 Feb 25 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Steve Bannon and Carrie Sheffield discussed the significance of recent victories in protecting women’s sports from transgender participation, framing it as a pivotal moment in exposing the left’s stance on women’s rights. Bannon recalled Sheffield’s early warnings about the issue, which were initially met with skepticism but have since proven accurate. Sheffield described the ruling as an “earthquake” and a “restoration of women’s rights,” highlighting how the left has shown indifference to women’s safety and fairness in sports. Sheffield criticized the Democratic Party for abandoning the feminist principles it once championed, arguing that its refusal to define “woman” has led to an inability to defend women’s rights. She framed the issue as part of a broader ideological battle between truth and disorder. Bannon echoed this sentiment, emphasizing that the struggle extends beyond politics into fundamental moral and cultural conflicts. They also addressed the Biden administration’s attempt to rewrite Title IX, accusing it of undermining the protections originally intended to ensure fairness for female athletes. While celebrating state-level victories, Sheffield stressed the need for federal protections to prevent funding from supporting schools that allow transgender athletes in women’s sports. She dismissed leftist claims that only privileged suburban girls care about the issue, arguing that it’s about upholding objective truth and foundational values.  Steve Bannon and Terry Shilling discussed the broader implications of the transgender movement on feminism, gender identity, and federal policies. Shilling recalled initial skepticism when the issue of biological men competing in women’s sports was first raised. He emphasized that the feminist left has been largely absent or complicit in the movement because their ultimate goal is to erase gender distinctions altogether. Shilling argued that this agenda seeks to create an androgynous society where men and women are indistinguishable, making people easier to control. He pointed out that the growing “gender industry” is a multi-billion-dollar business, heavily funded by taxpayer dollars through Medicaid and state funding, and that the push to normalize gender transitions has led to both adults and children being subjected to medical procedures. Bannon and Shilling agreed that Trump has successfully exposed this issue to the public, making it a top concern for swing voters. They stressed the importance of holding politicians accountable, forcing Democrats to take a public stance on whether biological men should compete in women’s sports. The issue remains a “live fire exercise,” with the potential to drive uncomfortable but necessary conversations that could shift electoral outcomes.  Natalie Winters reported from the WHite House and talked about the latest details of the Trump’s administration’s moves on USAID and the reaction from the Democrats.  Steve Bannon and Todd Bensman discussed several critical issues, focusing on border security, supply chains, and geopolitical tensions. Bensman noted that under Trump, illegal crossings at the southern border had dropped significantly to around 400-500 per day due to detentions, expulsions, and deportations. He emphasized that Mexico was now dealing with the brunt of the migrant crisis, as U.S. policies deterred crossings. He argued that securing the border was a matter of enforcing existing laws rather than requiring new legislation. Bannon and Bensman also discussed the role of the military in maintaining border security, stressing that continued enforcement was necessary to prevent a resurgence in illegal immigration. Bensman highlighted the shift in immigration policy, with fewer illegal crossings and increased deportations, particularly through flights to countries like India, China, and Colombia. Additionally, Bannon touched on supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly regarding pharmaceuticals, which remain heavily dependent on China. He urged preparedness, promoting Jace Medical as a solution for securing essential medicines. The conversation reflected broader concerns about national security, economic independence, and the effectiveness of Trump’s policies in addressing these challenges.
