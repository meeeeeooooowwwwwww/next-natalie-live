    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 7/16/2024 [AM]</h1>
    <div>Darren J. Beattie, in this segment, praises JD Vance, explaining why he believes Vance was a good choice for President Trump despite Vance’s past “Never Trump” remarks. Beattie emphasizes that Vance’s book, “Hillbilly Elegy,” captured the underlying issues driving the America First movement, indicating Vance’s ideological alignment with Trump’s goals. Beattie also highlights Vance’s opposition from establishment figures in media and politics, like Lindsey Graham, who Beattie says worked against Vance’s political career. He contends that Vance’s stances, particularly against foreign wars and misuse of taxpayer money, align with the America First agenda, making him a suitable pick for Trump’s vice presidential candidate and a significant player in the movement’s future.  Darren Beattie criticizes the Secret Service for their failures during an attempted assassination of President Trump, suggesting these failures may be due to incompetence or intentional neglect. He points out how the shooter managed to get on a roof with a rifle, and despite multiple warnings from the crowd, Secret Service officers failed to act. Beattie finds it suspicious that the shooter had no discernible internet footprint and questions how he knew the roof would be unguarded. He also highlights a pattern of Secret Service failures, referencing the January 6th pipe bomb incident. Beattie calls for thorough investigations into these security breaches, emphasizing the need for accountability and better protection for Trump at future events.  In this conversation, Darren Beattie emphasizes that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees the Secret Service, has redefined what it means to be a domestic extremist and terrorist, now largely targeting MAGA supporters. He suggests this redefinition might explain why threats to President Trump could slip through the cracks. Beattie also discusses the DHS’s weaponization against MAGA, mentioning figures like Bennie Thompson, who have pushed for actions against Trump. Beattie then discusses Elon Musk’s substantial financial support for pro-Trump PACs, highlighting Musk’s strategic move to ensure Trump’s victory for his business interests. He notes that significant figures in Silicon Valley are also backing Trump, creating a cascade effect of support within the tech industry. Beattie underscores the existential stakes for Musk and others if Trump does not win, asserting that this financial backing is crucial and encouraging for Trump’s campaign.  The filmmakers of “God’s Not Dead: In God We Trust,” David A.R. White and his team, joined Natalie Winters to discuss their upcoming film, which premieres on September 12th. This is the fifth installment of the most successful faith-based franchise in film history. The movie, which blends themes of faith and politics, aims to encourage discussions on current issues in America and rally Christians to be more politically involved, highlighting the statistic that up to 40 million American Christians are not registered to vote. White, a strong supporter of President Trump, emphasized the need for faith and values in politics, critiquing the current administration and Hollywood for lacking these elements. The filmmakers are promoting the film at the RNC and hope it will inspire greater civic participation among Christians.  Raheem Kassam and Natalie Winters discuss the increased stress on the RNC convention organizers due to heightened security and the need to keep attendees engaged, highlighting President Trump and other notable speakers’ efforts to motivate the crowd. They reflect on the high expectations placed on the event, especially given the challenging conditions. The conversation shifts to analyzing an assassination attempt on Trump, criticizing the Secret Service for significant security lapses. They question the lack of immediate action and transparency, expressing concerns about future safety measures at Trump events. Kassam and Winters also ponder the political implications of the incident, suggesting that it might be used to push anti-Trump narratives and increase security at future rallies. They emphasize the need for accountability and thorough investigations to prevent such failures from recurring.  In a discussion at the RNC, US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene spoke with Natalie Winters about the concept of unity being pushed in the wake of President Trump’s recent legal challenges. Greene criticized the idea of uniting with Democrats, highlighting what she sees as their divisive actions over the past years, such as opening borders, vilifying conservatives, and weaponizing the justice system against Trump supporters. She pointed out specific incidents like the treatment of January 6th protesters and pro-life activists and criticized attempts to remove Trump’s Secret Service protection. Greene contrasted the left’s reaction to threats against Biden with how Trump supporters reacted to recent events, emphasizing the peaceful response of prayer rather than violence. She mentioned the upcoming hearing with the Secret Service Director, overseen by the Homeland Security Committee, to address accountability and transparency in ongoing investigations. Greene expressed skepticism about the government’s reliability, citing past misinformation and emphasizing the need for patience as Republicans work to bring accountability.  The three agreed that JD Vance should be picked as the Vice President and shared their insights about Vance’s background, his book, and President Trump and Steve Bannon’s populist movement.  In the discussion, Dave Bossie, filling in for Steve Bannon, criticizes the Department of Justice’s actions against Bannon. Ted Cruz joins to discuss JD Vance’s selection as the vice-presidential nominee, praising Vance as a passionate and effective campaigner. Cruz believes this choice will lead to a landslide victory in November, emphasizing the clear contrast between Trump-Vance and Biden-Harris. Cruz then talks about Trump’s resilience, likening him to a UFC fighter and the Terminator, highlighting his persistence despite multiple impeachments, indictments, and attacks. They both express the emotional impact of Trump’s appearance at the convention. The conversation shifts to an assassination attempt on Trump, criticizing the Secret Service’s leadership for security failures. Cruz calls for the resignation of the Secret Service director and the Secretary of Homeland Security, citing the preventable nature of the attempt. Bossie mentions ongoing security concerns for the convention in Milwaukee. Cruz plans to address the southern border crisis in his upcoming speech at the RNC, highlighting violent crimes committed by illegal immigrants released by the Biden administration, and emphasizing the need for accountability and security.  Congressman Jim Jordan praised President Trump’s choice of JD Vance as vice presidential nominee, highlighting Vance’s humble beginnings and his potential to resonate with American voters. He emphasized Vance’s ability to connect with working-class and military communities, echoing Trump’s appeal. Jordan discussed the energetic atmosphere following Trump’s appearance at the convention, praising Trump’s resilience and leadership under pressure. He outlined key electoral battlegrounds and the campaign’s focus on contrasting their vision with what he perceives as the radical left’s agenda. Jordan underscored the importance of winning the upcoming election, framing it as pivotal for America’s future amidst ideological divisions.  David Bossie expressed his excitement about the upcoming film “Trump Saves America,” highlighting its relevance and impact. He mentioned the film’s premiere at the Miller High Life Theater in Milwaukee and emphasized its focus on themes such as the 2020 election and Mark Zuckerberg’s influence. Bossie reflected on past film projects and President Trump’s support, noting the president’s commitment to promoting the film’s message despite recent challenges. He encouraged viewers to visit TrumpSavesAmericaMovie.com for more information, inviting them to engage with the film’s content and attend its premiere.  </div>
