Ticket information: HERE  Steve Bannon discussed the many cases against President Trump, reconfirming his interest in a motion to vacate Speaker Mike Johnson. He addressed the footage of Mark Pomerantz taking the fifth while being grilled by US Rep. Matt Gaetz.  Bannon told the audience that the political will to elect Donald Trump was solid and leading but that the problem Trump faces is the lawfare being waged against him, which is why he is leading the charge for people to demand a criminal investigation into the actions that placed Trump in so many legal predicaments.  Larry Schweikart talked to Steve Bannon about the Populism movement and how Democrats who don’t like Biden either just fight dirty and underhanded and won’t stop over their pursuit of power.  Schweikart blamed the campus chaos on Democrats who planned these events, and are just now realizing the massive mistakes the riots will have on the Democrats agenda.  “In our movement, the Citizen comes first” -Steve Bannon This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, "Action, Action, Action,” as  Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) “I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said, adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: “This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the “Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. “I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn Posse.. go do some action and be a part of your own nation’s history. </div>
