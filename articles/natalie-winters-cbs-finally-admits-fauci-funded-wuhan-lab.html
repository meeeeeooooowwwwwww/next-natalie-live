    <h1>Natalie Winters: CBS Finally Admits Fauci Funded Wuhan Lab.</h1>
    <div>Executive editor of WarRoom Natalie Winters joins Steve Bannon to discuss how the mainstream media is attempting to cover up evidence that WarRoom reported on years ago showing how the federal government was funding gain-of-function research and the Wuhan lab. Diversion of this evidence comes as the mainstream media finally admits the true origins of COVID-19 from the Wuhan lab in China. "this comes on the heals of the DOE report on the origins of Covid saying that it likely came from a labâ€¦and of course Dr. Robert Redfield saying that Fauci and particularly the federal government all the way to the Department of Defense had been funding gain-of-function research." </div>
