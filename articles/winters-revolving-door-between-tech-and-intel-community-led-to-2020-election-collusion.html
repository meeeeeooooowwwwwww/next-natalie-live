    <h1>Winters: "Revolving Door" Between Tech And Intel Community Led To 2020 Election Collusion</h1>
    <div>“War Room” executive editor Natalie Winters talks to host Steve Bannon about the congressional hearing that examined the collusion between Twitter and Big Tech and the Intel Community to stop Trump and crush conservatives. “I think if you really drill down, the bigger picture which I think we really got the evidence for today, is the fact that, forget foreign election interference… what we saw today was evidence of domestic election interference, particularly by Big Tech platforms like Twitter, but really colluding with the Intel Community.”  </div>
