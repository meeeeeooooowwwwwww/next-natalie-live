    <div>Cold Open started with Jamie Raskin mocking official proceedings and being a clown, and it opened with footage of Matt Gaez and others in front of the courthouse at a press conference.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, which proceeded into a huge dust-up with AOC having a tantrum. Juxtaposed with the footage from the courthouse.  MSNBC footage showed Rachel Madow in a panic “This is like a tale of two cities, full meltdown. We are hurling toward a Constitutional crisis.  I think it is becoming clear about the Biden tapes, and about Biden’s participation with documents- and that is why Trump’s charges are so strange,” Steve Bannon May 17 (Bob Good Segment).

Congressman Bob Good led the House Freedom Caucus in a defense of President Trump in front of the nation. Meanwhile, the Oversight and Judiciary Committees delved into a Firestorm regarding Merrick Garland’s contempt of Congress over subpoenaed tapes, with the White House invoking executive privilege. Congressman Good described his experience in New York City court, criticizing what he perceives as a biased prosecution and a witness with personal vendettas against Trump. He sees this as part of a larger effort by Democrats to hinder Trump’s political future, from attempting to keep him off the ballot in 2020 to now potentially imprisoning him. Good emphasized the solidarity of the House Freedom Caucus in supporting Trump and challenging the narrative around his legal battles. Despite facing criticism, he remains committed to defending Trump and confronting what he sees as unfair treatment by the legal system and political opponents.  The recent events surrounding the defense of President Trump in court and the scrutiny over documents related to Biden’s past actions have raised concerns about political bias and potential interference in the upcoming elections. Jeff Clark criticized media portrayal of congressional support for Trump as nefarious, highlighting the predominance of leftist figures in the courtroom. He emphasized the legitimate oversight role of Congress amidst accusations of interference. The focus on Biden’s documents has sparked suspicion, with questions raised about the timing and motivations behind the scrutiny. The debate over executive privilege and access to relevant information further complicates the situation, with concerns about a potential constitutional crisis looming. Clark brought up Robert Hurr and talked about the tapes that he recorded.  Mike Lindell talked about the uprising against Minnesota adopting what he described as an Islamic flag, talking about the process of how the state changed their flag, and why people are upset.  Lindell told Bannon that even Democrats were upset by it so it could be a unifying scandal.  Lindell also talked about special deals he had for the WarRoom audience- low prices on sheets and a free flag pillow.

(Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) “I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said, adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: “This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the “Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. “I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn, Posse. Take action and be a part of your nation’s history.  </div>
