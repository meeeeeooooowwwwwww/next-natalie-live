    <h1>EXC: Federal Government Is Starting COVID-19 ‘Emergency’ Contracts Expiring In 2025.</h1>
    <div>The Department of Health and Human Services has begun rolling out federal contracts for “COVID-19 response” with start dates scheduled in September and concluding in the year 2025, War Room can reveal. The unearthed contracts, which can be viewed on the federal government’s spending database, follow a separate War Room exclusive detailing similar behavior from the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has inked a contract with the Virginia-based Goldbelt Apex, which is active in the health information technology space. Among its areas of focus are “coordination of response to public health emergencies” and “surveillance.” The contract, which is set to begin on the future date of September 17th, 2023, is reportedly for “program management office supporting initiatives that strengthen COVID-19 response and address emerging public health emergencies,” according to a synopsis. The contract is currently worth $1,816,071.23 but could potentially be raised to $4,156,434.07 by its potential end date of March 16th, 2025. The unearthed contracts follow the mainstream media hyping an alleged surge in COVID-19 cases across America, which also dovetails with COVID-19 vaccine makers such as Pfizer experiencing a rapid decline in profits.</div>
