They mention past practices involving Dropbox and Mark Zuckerberg that were deemed detrimental to the Metaverse concept. The conversation then shifts to allegations of a new scheme where undocumented immigrants are allegedly being encouraged to register to vote, potentially impacting elections. Winters and Hoft discuss Gateway Pundit reporting on receiving letters in Spanish encouraging undocumented immigrants to register to vote after obtaining various government documents, such as driver’s licenses and social security numbers. They express concerns about the legality and ethical implications of this practice, highlighting potential criminal charges for both the immigrants and those facilitating their registration. The conversation speculates on the extent of this alleged voter registration scheme, suggesting it may not be limited to Florida and could potentially involve multiple states. They also ponder the motives behind such actions, debating whether it represents a strategic pivot in election rigging tactics or a continuation of existing practices. Throughout the discussion, there’s an underlying skepticism towards the Biden administration and suspicions of deep state involvement in election manipulation. The speakers emphasize the importance of addressing voter fraud and cleaning up voter rolls to ensure the integrity of future elections.  Dr. Seb Gorka spoke with Natalie Winters about the history of the FISA structure that is currently causing battles in Washington, DC.  The discussion centers around the state of the economy, particularly government spending, inflation, and economic growth. Economist Dave Brat expressed skepticism about government officials’ portrayal of economic resilience and growth. He argued that government borrowing and spending artificially inflate economic growth figures and warn of the consequences of such actions. Brat criticized the manipulation of economic data, citing an example of gas prices being reported as lower despite actual increases. They emphasize the importance of scrutinizing economic indicators and not solely relying on official reports. He referenced an inflation paper authored by Larry Summers, a prominent economist, which suggests that inflation may be higher than reported. He also presented a chart comparing current inflation trends to historical patterns, suggesting a potential upcoming increase in inflation. Overall, the discussion highlights concerns about the accuracy of economic data, the impact of government spending on economic growth, and the potential for higher inflation in the future.  Natalie Winters and Mike Linell discuss recent developments related to legal actions concerning election integrity. Lindell expressed optimism about multiple states joining an amicus brief regarding a Supreme Court case on election integrity scheduled for consideration on April 19. He highlighted the importance of securing elections and expressed hope for positive changes. Following this discussion, there is a transition to promoting products available for purchase for the War Room on the My Pillow website, emphasizing exclusive free shipping offers. The products range from pillows to slippers to bedsheets, with various deals and discounts highlighted.  The conversation delves into artificial intelligence’s (AI) implications on human society, drawing attention to warnings issued by influential figures like Eric Schmidt and Sam Altman. Schmidt discusses the inevitability of AI integration into human life and suggests that individuals will become dependent on AI companions. This prospect raises concerns about the potential for disruption to social order and individual autonomy. The discussion emphasizes the seriousness of these warnings, mainly as they come from respected institutions like Japanese telecommunications giant and major newspapers in Japan. Additionally, there’s skepticism about the benefits of AI, with concerns raised about the role of AI in reshaping society and potentially leading to societal collapse. Overall, the conversation highlights the urgency of addressing AI technology’s ethical and societal implications.  The conversation between Steve Bannon and Movie producer Tiffany Meier, centers on the influence of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Hollywood and its broader implications for American society. It begins with a discussion about the CCP’s advanced efforts to infiltrate various aspects of American life, including the film industry. The film “Hollywood Takeover” is highlighted as a response to this infiltration, aiming to expose the CCP’s control and its impact on shaping narratives in American entertainment. The film delves into how Hollywood’s cooperation with China has compromised American values, democracy, and human rights. Meier explains the film’s genesis and its importance in raising awareness about the CCP’s influence. The conversation underscores the need for vigilance against CCP influence and provides ways to access the documentary for further insight. Overall, it emphasizes the significance of understanding and addressing the CCP’s tactics in shaping global narratives and influencing public opinion.  The conversation with Ben Harnwell begins with a discussion about the FISA issue. The conversation then shifts to Ukraine, focusing on President Zelensky signing a bill to lower the conscription age. This has prompted concern among families reluctant to see their young sons be conscripted. The New York Times has published articles highlighting the human cost and political implications of this decision, revealing hesitancy among Ukrainian parents to send their children into the conflict. The discussion underscores the complexity of Ukraine’s situation and the challenges faced by both the government and its citizens. Additionally, the conversation touches on broader geopolitical issues and the upcoming trial of the century, indicating a turbulent period ahead.  This newsletter is to put into action the work of WarRoom guests.  Remember-“Action, Action, Action,” as Steve Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) "I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said , adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: "This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the "Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. "I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn Posse.. go do some action and be a part of your own nation’s history.</div>
