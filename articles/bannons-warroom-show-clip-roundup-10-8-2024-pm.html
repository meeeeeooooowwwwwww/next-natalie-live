    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 10/8/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Natalie talked about her dismay over a couple of National Headlines and talked about Russian Collusion.  Steve Friend joined Natalie Winters to talk about the actions of the Intel agencies, which appeared to him to be in operations as secret police more than American institutions.  Natalie Winters talked about Mark Zuckerberg’s 2020 Get Out the Vote efforts and how the corporate media discussed his operations, which are very different from how they discuss voter engagement and get-out-the-vote efforts from Republicans- especially how they are reporting Elon Musk’s support for President Trump.  Phillip Patrick discussed the rising cost of living under Joe Biden and the truth about the employment rates being lower than has been reported. Patrick also discussed Bidenonomics and inflation.  Citizen Kane discussed the latest posts, polling, and voter registrations and how they are connected, and they also discussed Kamala Harris’s appearance on The View.  Alex DeGrasse talked about people having a list of 10 people who they believe they can influence and get them to vote.  Alex DeGrasse reminded the audience that turnout is the key, adding that young people are turning toward Trump in large numbers, but they often do not show up to vote.  DeGrasse encouraged people to focus on getting young people out to vote.  Grace Chong talked about signing up for the WarRoom newsletter for JoJo’s articles, which will have links on where to go for grassroots and how to get involved with the election. Those articles, she said, are expected to be posted soon and she encouraged people to pass them around by email once they got the articles.  Chong added that people should be following her social media on X for Steve’s older clips, his general messaging, and inspiration. She also talked about the numerous voter apps that she wants people to engage with, making sure to tell people to vote for Republicans so we can hold the House and get the Senate, adding that turnout is essential. Hence, we need to be optimistic about the election and Republican candidates. Chong said that people should email any questions to JoJo, who will give everyone the “White Glove Treatment to help them get engaged in their local area or with groups she knows about,” adding that since she and JoJo started this email campaign a couple of days ago, there has been a “flood of emails,” noting that there is a lot of excitement and questions from the Possee. </div>
