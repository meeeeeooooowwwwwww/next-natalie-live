    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 12/16/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Steve Bannon and Dave Bratt engaged in a wide-ranging conversation touching on politics, Ukraine, and the global implications of U.S. foreign policy. Bannon, reflecting on his role in the populist-nationalist movement, discussed his recent interactions at the New York Young Republicans Club dinner, which had become a significant gathering for nationalist thought. He highlighted the contrast between President Trump’s powerful speech and the crowd’s response, emphasizing the vibrant populist energy surrounding these events. Bratt, who had recently visited Ukraine with Christian leaders and think tank members, provided insights into the ongoing war, focusing on the political maneuvering of NATO countries. He explained that while he sympathizes with the Ukrainian people, he sees the West’s involvement as a manipulation, with nations like the U.S. and NATO seeking to maintain influence in the region. Bratt critiqued the narrative pushed by the U.S. government and its intelligence agencies, framing it as an example of failed diplomacy and foreign intervention. He pointed out the U.S. role in the 2014 Ukrainian coup and the lack of accountability for such actions, which he believes have led to the current crisis. Both men expressed skepticism about the motivations behind the war in Ukraine, with Bannon questioning the justifications for continued support. Bratt emphasized the need for a more honest conversation about the war’s roots and its broader geopolitical implications. They also touched on the role of Christian leaders, asserting that faith communities should seek peace and reconciliation rather than contribute to further division. Ultimately, both Bannon and Bratt called for a reevaluation of U.S. foreign policy, urging a shift toward prioritizing national interests and moral clarity. Part One:  Part Two:  Ben Bergquam, Oscar Ramirez, and Steve Bannon discuss the serious implications of illegal immigration and border security as President Trump prepares for his transition to office. Bergquam highlights the dangers posed by illegal alien “runners,” individuals trying to avoid detection while crossing the southern border, often with criminal backgrounds. These figures are facilitated by cartels exploiting asylum loopholes, leading to an influx of dangerous individuals. Oscar Ramirez echoes this concern, emphasizing the cartel’s growing power under the Biden administration, calling for immediate action to label cartels as terrorists and to leverage tariffs against Mexico to curb their operations. Bannon expands on the broader context, critiquing the Biden administration for exacerbating the border crisis and the political resistance to closing the border. He highlights the challenge President Trump faces, especially with the entrenched opposition from Republican senators like Mitch McConnell, who have been dismissive of the America First movement. Bannon stresses the need for immediate action on securing the border, including mass deportations, and insists that border security must be prioritized over other legislative concerns. He calls out McConnell for undermining Trump’s agenda and promoting an open-border policy, positioning it as a direct betrayal of American interests. The trio emphasizes that only President Trump has the will to address the crisis effectively and humanely, despite significant political resistance. Part One:  Part Two:  Natalie Winters talked about the Cyber attacks on America from the Chinese Community Party.  Part One:  Part Two:  Part One:  Part Two: </div>
