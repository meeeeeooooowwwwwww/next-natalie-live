    <h1>Architect of ‘Get Trump’ May End up as Pathfinder to Criminal Conspiracy Probe: Pomerantz’s Plea Raises Questions</h1>
    <div>According to a House Judiciary Committee letter, in 2023, Mark Pomerantz, a former Manhattan prosecutor who was working underneath DA Alvin Bragg, and who led investigations into Donald Trump’s finances and stirred up a huge controversy when he stomped off in a huff and resigned, faced questioning over his actions by the House Judiciary Committee, led then by US Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH). And his bizarre behavior and reaction to being questioned about his anti-Trump demands are re-merging this week, threatening to take down the dreams of Trump’s opponents like a fragile house of cards. The WarRoom is front and center on this issue and deconstructs how we got here and where this might be headed. On Thursday, the same Judiciary committee, led by Jordan, officially and finally released the footage of the 2023 Jordan meeting with Pomerantz. So, the released 2023 footage is cited in a Thursday report, along with a link to a 300-page interim report that was released last week. WarRoom, which has focused on this report for days, reported on the huge interim report at the time of its release, titled AN ANATOMY OF A POLITICAL PROSECUTION: THE MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE’S VENDETTA AGAINST PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP. Now, something is happening. According to US Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FLA), Pomerantz chose, in 2023, to plead the Fifth Amendment to almost every question that was posed to him during the Judiciary interview, raising concerns then about the potential future dismissal of cases against Trump. Those questions and answers are coming up again during the same time a multipronged campaign, led by Steve Bannon and the WarRoom,is demanding a broader probe by the entire US House into a potential criminal conspiracy against President Trump. KEY POINT ON POMERANTZ ISSUE: In 2023, Pomerantz participated in numerous high-profile media interviews in the context of his tell-all book on Trump, which was really a temper tantrum where he criticized Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg for not pursuing charges against Trump quickly enough and on Pomerantz’s timing. Pomerantz’s book, “People versus Donald Trump,” alleges that Trump committed financial crimes and should have been prosecuted more extensively- so quit his job, pouted off, wrote a book and did interviews to spread his message that Trump needed to be prosecuted and Bragg wasn’t going fast enough for him. Then he was hauled into DC and asked about all of this, but he refused to answer because he would incriminate himself. SO! Pomerantz’s decision to plead the Fifth raises questions about the strength of the cases against Trump and potential violations of legal ethics statutes during his time at the Manhattan DA’s office. At the time, in 2023, Gaetz talked about this question of whether his actions would derail the whole Trump case openly.  In a video then, Gaetz said that he believed that there is was subject matter waiver of Pomerantz’s Fifth Amendment rights; he hints at the possibility of compelling him to respond through a court order. Therefore- It is not new information that Gaetz interrogated Pomerantz. Still, it is noteworthy that Gaetz posted footage of Pomperantz taking the fifth in 2023 on Thursday amidst a week and a half of the consistent torrent of political moves by numerous US House members to finally fight back against President Donald J. Trump’s lawfare. This appears to slowly be building Bannon’s case that a serious investigation into a potential criminal conspiracy against Trump and others is warranted. And it shows that Bannon is right to suspect that someone is to blame for Republicans not being more organized and on the offense to help Trump. On Thursday, Gaetz’s  X post caught the attention of Steve Bannon: “Trump Prosecutor PLEADS FIFTH when asked if he BROKE THE LAW investigating Trump!” Gaetz posted on X.  Bannon played the shocking footage of Pomerantz repeatedly taking the fifth as a cold open and briefly addressed the Gaetz post on his morning WarRoom program. Later, Mike Davis sounded off about the afternoon program with Natalie Winters, suggesting that the House Judiciary Committee could give Pomerantz immunity to testify about what Bragg was doing. Bannon then, in WarRoom’s final hour, further sounded off the Pomerantz footage, showing that the situation could be a key issue:  Bannon questioned numerous times why this footage was coming out now and expressed frustration that if it were not for people like the WarRoom audience demanding action, nothing would happen. It appeared that House Republicans would keep dragging their feet about protecting Trump. That point is foundational in why Bannon demands that Speaker Mike Johnson must be unseated, so this Pomerantz issue is also about the looming Motion to Vacate. TIMELINE -DEEP DIVE 2023 Mark Pomerantz resigns Mark Pomerantz’s book tour was criticized by legal minds. Mark Pomerantz 60 mins interview about why he resigned and about his book House Judiciary Committee released a letter: EXCLUSIVE: House Judiciary Expands Investigation Into Manhattan DA Over Trump Indictment. Flashback to an Epoch Times article that may throw a monkey wrench into the Democrat’s claims about the whole dream to crush Trump: A federal judge in New York sided with Congressman Jim Jordan in a lawsuit involving Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and former prosecutor Mark Pomerantz. The judge ruled that Pomerantz must respond to a congressional inquiry into the prosecution of former President Donald Trump, citing Pomerantz’s book as a basis for her decision. Bragg argued against the subpoena, fearing it would reveal confidential information, but the judge rejected his concerns, stating that the congressional inquiry serves a valid legislative purpose. Pomerantz’s book, released after he left the DA’s office, criticized Bragg’s handling of the case against Trump. "Pomerantz is in this situation because he decided to inject himself in the public debate.” By publishing a book about the Trump investigation, ex-prosecutor Mark Pomerantz created a predicament for himself—and for @ManhattanDA Alvin Bragg. https://t.co/r6iESPoYAf — The Epoch Times (@EpochTimes) April 21, 2023  War Room will update as more information becomes available.
