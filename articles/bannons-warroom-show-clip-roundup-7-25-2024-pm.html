    <div>In an interview with Natalie Winters, Catherine Engelbrecht from True the Vote highlighted significant concerns about election integrity, focusing on potential voter fraud linked to ActBlue and non-citizen voting. Engelbrecht described the alleged scheme, where donors unwittingly contribute to Democratic candidates through small, frequent donations under their names, stating, “This is identity theft, this is wire fraud.” Engelbrecht argued that Democrats exploit voter rolls to target defenseless individuals, particularly lower-income ones, who might not fight back. “They are exploiting the defenseless, and it’s disgusting,” she remarked, stressing the necessity for increased citizen involvement. Despite improvements in citizen engagement, Engelbrecht rated election security progress since 2020 as insufficient, around “50%.” She expressed concerns about mail-in voting, deemed the “least secure way” to vote, and criticized the push for it despite security risks. Engelbrecht also highlighted issues with non-citizen registrations, blaming outdated voter roll maintenance and the National Voter Registration Act’s integration with social services, which obscures citizenship verification. Engelbrecht urged for more robust measures, noting, “There is absolute evidence that non-citizens are being registered.” She encouraged citizens to engage in projects like the 611 project to pressure state representatives to clean voter rolls, warning, “We’re running out of time.” Engelbrecht concluded by inviting participation and promoting transparency and accountability in the election process. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Natalie Winters criticized Kamala Harris’s role as the “Border Czar,” emphasizing how media outlets like Axios, The New York Times, and CNN have subtly altered headlines to distance Harris from the border crisis. Winters noted, “They do not want to own what is happening…because they know that it is political suicide,” suggesting that these policies have alienated the Democratic base. The discussion highlighted a distrust in the government, pointing to systemic failures across multiple sectors, from education to public safety. Winters argued that these issues reflect a deeper intention to undermine American interests, claiming, “Our elites are much more sinister, nefarious, calculating, and intentional.” She concluded that it is up to American citizens to challenge these failures, stating that the government is more interested in its agenda than genuinely serving the people. This conversation underscores ongoing concerns about political accountability and public trust.  In a recent discussion with Natalie Winters, Tiffany Justice shared promising developments regarding the Title IX lawsuit that Moms for Liberty is spearheading. Justice highlighted that a judge clarified a previous ruling, allowing current and future members of Moms for Liberty to exempt their children’s schools from the Biden Administration’s new Title IX regulations. She explained, “The judge clarified his order on Friday and said that not only do current Moms for Liberty members qualify…but also any future Moms for Liberty members.” This is a significant victory, as it means that schools associated with Moms for Liberty members are not required to implement these controversial Title IX changes, which include allowing boys on girls’ sports teams, boys in girls’ locker rooms, and withholding information from parents about gender transitions. Justice emphasized the importance of this ruling, stating, “If you’re a Moms for Liberty member, your school cannot enforce those new regulation changes.” She encouraged parents to join the organization, noting that new members can also ensure their child’s school is exempt. Justice thanked the Southeastern Legal Foundation for their support, remarking on their crucial role in this legal battle. To support the cause, she urged people to text "Liberty” to a specific number to join and protect their children’s rights. Part One:  Part Two:  In a discussion with Joe Allen, Connie Elliott, a strategic analyst on the Committee on the Present Danger: China, addresses the intensifying issues of tribalization and political polarization in the digital age. Elliott highlights what she describes as how the “bizarre digital environment” exacerbates these natural problems by creating “digital silos” that foster hatred among individuals. She explains that generative machine learning systems have transformed the information landscape, making traditional information campaigns indistinguishable. These systems optimize information environments, influencing behavior and decision-making. Elliott points out that experiments like Google’s, which manipulated user behavior in crowded environments, demonstrate the power of these systems: “The moment you take the smartphone, you’ve basically signed up for a multitude of psychological experiments.” She also touches on the psychological impact of search engine manipulation and the absence of legal protections against subliminal advertising, stating, “There’s no protection in law at all.” Allen adds that this manipulation contributes to phenomena like “Trump Derangement Syndrome,” where individuals react irrationally to specific triggers.  In a discussion on misinformation, Joe Allen and Shane Cashman explore the concept of “post-reality,” where, according to Cashman, “everything can be true and nothing is true.” They discuss how the internet has accelerated this phenomenon, creating a “mutated fractured world” where people can find information to support any belief with a simple Google search. Cashman highlights how AI and deep fakes exacerbate this issue, making it difficult to discern truth even when witnessing events firsthand. He points to an example where a video allegedly showing a fake conversation between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris was analyzed as a deep fake, illustrating how easily manipulated information can gain traction. Cashman explains, “Even if you’re a witness to it, you don’t really know.” This conversation underscores the challenges of navigating a digital landscape filled with misinformation and manipulated content.  In this discussion with Joe Allen, Tim Hinchcliffe highlights digital identity concerns, emphasizing its role in tracking and controlling individuals. Hinchcliffe notes that digital ID systems are designed to “eliminate all anonymity,” allowing for precise tracking of misinformation sources. He describes these systems as a “never-ending nudge system” to manipulate behavior, potentially leading to social credit systems. Citing the World Economic Forum, Hinchcliffe explains that digital identity determines access to “products, services, and information” and can simultaneously restrict opportunities. While Melinda Gates promotes digital IDs for financial inclusion, Hinchcliffe warns that they serve as a “track and trace” tool, monitoring social media activity, medical records, voting behavior, and more. Quoting Klaus Schwab, he states that monitoring systems are extending to people, creating a world where “authoritarianism is easier” due to “total visibility and traceability.” Hinchcliffe argues that the third world often serves as a “laboratory” for these systems, exploiting desperate populations willing to surrender privacy for access. </div>
