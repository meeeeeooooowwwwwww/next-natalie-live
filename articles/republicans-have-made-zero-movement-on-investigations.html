    <h1>Republicans Have Made ZERO Movement On Investigations</h1>
    <div>“War Room” co-host Natalie Winters talks to Mike Davis of the Article III Project about his assessment of how the GOP Congress is doing in holding the Biden administration accountable. Hint: They haven’t done anything. “The House Republicans have been in power for nearly two months, and they’ve known that they won power for nearly four months. … So the question I have for these select committees… on the weaponization of the DOJ and the Intel Communities, the Covid Scam Committee and the China Committee, where in the hell are the oversight hearings, where in the hell are the subpoenas?… Why are we wasting so much time!”  </div>
