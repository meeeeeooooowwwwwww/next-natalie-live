Tom Jones takes about organizations that are helping illegal aliens with legal fees after they encounter problems for illegally entering the United States.  Jim Hoft promoted his investigations into overseas voting issues, which he claims run afoul to voter integrity laws.  Hoft claims that Iranian hackers broke into numerous states voter roll databases.  Eric Underwood highlighted Nebraska’s early voting situation and its critical importance this election cycle. He emphasized that voters still have time to register in person until 11:59 p.m. this Friday at election commission offices or county clerk locations. “We’re seeing an amazing amount of early vote turnout,” he noted, underscoring increased in-person participation. The stakes are high, with both Senate seats up for grabs due to Senator Ricketts finishing Senator Sasse’s term and Senator Deb Fischer seeking re-election. Underwood pointed out Nebraska’s pivotal Second Congressional District, which holds a unique electoral vote that could determine the presidential race: "This could be the determination of whether or not you have President Trump in or you have four more years of Biden.” He expressed confidence in the district going “2016 red,” highlighting a robust ground game targeting low-propensity voters. Nebraska has seen a notable shift in voter registration, with the Republican base growing. "People are switching to become Republicans,” Underwood said, pointing to increased engagement and grassroots efforts at universities and community events. He believes turnout will be historically high, projecting 75-80% participation statewide.  Noah Formica talked about chasing ballots for Turning Point USA.  Brady Penfield talked about ballot-chasing operations for Turning Point USA in Wisconsin.
