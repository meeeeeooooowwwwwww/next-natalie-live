    <h1>Natalie Winters Bashes NYT For Weak Pro-Fauci Propaganda.</h1>
    <div>Natalie Winters co-host and executive editor of War Room joins Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro to discuss the mainstream media pushing pro-Fauci propaganda. Winters explains the hypocritical remarks my Fauci in his attempt to make case for gain-of-function research, "Even though he thinks he’s making a case for gain of function research there he’s actually I think in other words incriminating himself in terms of funding the Wuhan  Institute of Virology and gain-of-function research and the broader problem that we always raise on this show which is the same people who were engaged in pandemic prevention were doing so to create the vaccines that they made billions if not trillions of dollars off of.” </div>
