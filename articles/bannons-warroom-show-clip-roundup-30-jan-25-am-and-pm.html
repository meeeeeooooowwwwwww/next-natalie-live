    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 30 Jan 25 [AM and PM]</h1>
    <div>President Trump had a press conference and spoke for about 35 min. Dealing the details he had about the American Airlines crash on Wednesday night at Regan Airport.  Mary Holland and Steve Bannon discussed Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s performance in his confirmation hearings, emphasizing the political and corporate resistance he faces, particularly from the pharmaceutical industry. Bannon noted that Kennedy was subjected to tough, brutal questioning, but he held his own. The hearings were not just about approval but about limiting Kennedy’s options if he were to advance. Holland highlighted the pharmaceutical industry’s influence over Congress and its hostility toward Kennedy, whom they see as a threat due to his push for transparency and independent scientific scrutiny. She described the “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) movement as a growing political force, particularly among mothers advocating for health reforms. They also discussed Senator Bill Cassidy’s pivotal role in the Finance Committee vote, stressing the importance of grassroots pressure to secure Kennedy’s confirmation. While Cassidy adheres to mainstream medical narratives, Holland believes he is persuadable. Bannon and Holland agreed that Kennedy’s approach—focusing on transparency and gold-standard science—aligns with Trump’s vision and resonates with a broad audience. They underscored the movement’s long-term significance, framing it as a historic grassroots uprising that politicians cannot ignore without political consequences.

Naomi Wolf and Steve Bannon discussed the intense scrutiny and attacks RFK Jr. faced, particularly regarding vaccines and public health policies. Wolf framed the moment as a pivotal test, where political and corporate elites sought to derail him. She described the hearings as revealing a desperate, almost ritualistic opposition from Democratic senators, who seemed to be defending pharmaceutical interests at all costs rather than engaging in scientific debate. Bannon emphasized the aggressive tactics used against RFK Jr., noting the same hostility had been directed at other populist figures like Trump, Matt Gaetz, and Tulsi Gabbard. The conversation suggested the hearings were more than political theater—they exposed a deep ideological divide, where RFK Jr. stood as a lone voice against entrenched interests. Wolf noted that while RFK Jr. delivered a solid performance, the real victory lay in how the opposition revealed itself. Senators who attacked him appeared emotionally unhinged, dogmatic, and unwilling to address concerns about chronic disease and corporate influence over public health. Bannon and Wolf agreed that this moment should be leveraged by RFK Jr.’s and Trump’s teams to highlight the establishment’s irrational resistance to questioning pharmaceutical narratives. Ultimately, Wolf viewed RFK Jr.’s resilience as a spiritual battle, comparing his unwavering commitment to truth with Trump’s. She concluded that the hearings weren’t just about RFK Jr.—they exposed the broader struggle between populist truth-tellers and the institutional forces trying to silence them.  Steve Bannon and Jim Rickards discussed the recent attacks on Tulsi Gabbard during her confirmation hearing, highlighting her composed demeanor and ability to handle adversarial questioning. Rickards praised Gabbard for not falling into “gotcha” traps and emphasized that her meeting with Bashar al-Assad was a standard intelligence-gathering move rather than an endorsement. They noted that the smear tactics used against her mirrored past Democratic strategies, branding dissenters as “Russian assets” for challenging the Ukraine war narrative. Rickards asserted that Gabbard’s stance on Ukraine aligns more with reality than the mainstream U.S. intelligence community, which he accused of distorting facts to shape policy. He argued that Putin’s strategic assessment of the war is largely correct, while U.S. agencies continue to push Ukrainian propaganda. The discussion also touched on Section 702 surveillance abuses, with Gabbard advocating for reforms to prevent warrantless spying on Americans. Bannon and Rickards agreed that the intelligence community has failed at its core mission—collecting accurate intelligence—while excelling at manipulating policy decisions. They concluded that the deep state, through inter-agency influence, has overstepped its role, and a reformed approach to intelligence is necessary to restore credibility.  Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters discussed the ongoing confirmation hearings for key Trump nominees, analyzing media reactions and political implications. Winters noted that while figures like Tulsi Gabbard and Kash Patel had strong showings, media coverage seemed less panicked about RFK Jr., suggesting they may see his nomination as unlikely. She also highlighted how mainstream outlets are strategically avoiding outrage over nominees to prevent giving Republicans an advantage. Bannon pointed out how the press couldn’t resist reacting to Trump’s press conference, where he criticized “woke” hiring policies, particularly in aviation. He cited reports of a diversity-hired helicopter pilot with limited experience, arguing that such policies lead to incompetence. Winters emphasized the urgency of confirming Trump’s nominees to counteract what she described as the Biden administration’s failures. The conversation then shifted to immigration, where Winters highlighted lawsuits to block mass deportations, particularly those backed by groups like the ACLU. She criticized these efforts as taxpayer-funded resistance against enforcing immigration laws. The segment concluded with a mention of Daily Mail’s coverage of political and cultural issues, reinforcing the idea that media narratives play a crucial role in shaping public perception. </div>
