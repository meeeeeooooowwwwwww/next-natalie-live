    <div>Natalie Winters talks to the editor of Citizen Kane about the lead story in the morning news. Joe Scarborough and his wife, Mika, sought an audience with President Donald Trump. Kane and Winters talk about the irony of that situation after the couple have appeared on MSNBC to mock Trump and marginalize his supporters.  Col. Derek Harvey and Natalie Winters talk about the breaking news from Sunday that Democrat Joe Biden authorized US Missle use for Ukraine, escalating war against Russia and escalating the cost of that war for the American people, just weeks before the end of his term as President.  Natalie Winters talks to Dr. Hatfill about the details of how Washington DC bureaucrats called the Administrative State-Deep Sate have been sabotaging President Trump since the beginning of his administration, making special note of how that impacted the COVID-19 crisis that happened toward the end of President Trump’s term.  Darren Beattie of Revolver News talked about his coverage of the nomination of Matt Gaetz to Attorney General and the recent news from President Trump that he will push the process to make sure that Gaetz is confirmed by the Senate, which appears to be dragging their feet about and amid corporate media attacks on Gaetz to try to stall the nomination process.  Mike Davis of the Article 3 project talked about his group’s advocacy of President Trump and Matt Gaetz in the upcoming nomination for Gaetz to serve as Attorney General.  Davis spoke to Steve Bannon about the process as we advance and what he expected to happen, including the reasons he supports Gaetz and believes Gaetz will uncover so much corruption in the judicial system.   Jeff Clark from the Center for Renewing America talked to Steve Bannon about the confirmation process and the opposition he expected to see from Trump’s opponents. Clark also discussed the steps President Trump and his supporters can take to ensure the much-needed nominees make it past confirmation.  Jim Rickards discussed the importance of President Trump’s nominations and how Trump’s success is central to restoring the United States’ economy, financial markets, and geopolitics as a key first step in the America First process. </div>
