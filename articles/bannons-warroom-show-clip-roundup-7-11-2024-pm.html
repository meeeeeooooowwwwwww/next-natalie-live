    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 7/11/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>In a conversation between Darren Beattie and Natalie Winters, the discussion centers on the political dynamics surrounding President Biden and Project 2025. Beattie and Winters suggest that the Democrats’ focus is primarily on criticizing Project 2025 and other social issues. Beattie expresses a preference for Project 2025 over the current administration’s policies, highlighting concerns about Biden’s leadership and the media’s role in shaping public perception. They delve into the internal conflicts within the Democratic Party, noting the speculation about Biden stepping down and the potential elevation of Kamala Harris. Beattie, a former Trump administration official, criticizes the media’s treatment of Biden, arguing that their recent criticisms are attempts to salvage their own credibility rather than improve the Democratic ticket’s prospects. Beattie emphasizes that the media’s lies and timing have placed the Democrats in a difficult position. He believes that replacing Biden now would invite chaos and further damage their chances in the 2024 election. The conversation highlights the media’s role in political narratives and the strategic challenges facing both parties.  Natalie Winters set out a call to action for people to call the US House about the failure to hold Merrick Garland accountable.  Mike Benz suggests that the Democrats will continue to use Russiagate to frame any pro-Trump, anti-Biden, or NATO-skeptical voices as potential threats backed by Russia. This strategy allows federal investigators to target and censor domestic influencers and political opponents, leveraging FISA and other tools. Benz notes the shift in focus from foreign to domestic disinformation and highlights the need for a perceived foreign threat to justify renewed social media censorship. He warns that the CIA’s actions will support this narrative, making it difficult for dissenting voices to operate freely online.  Mike McCormick, a former Biden staffer, discusses Joe Biden’s health decline and the internal conflict within the Democratic Party. He believes Biden, despite his decline, is determined to stay in office unless forced out by a higher power. McCormick identifies key figures in Biden’s inner circle, such as Steve Ricchetti and Tom Donilon, who support him. He highlights tensions between the Biden, Obama, and Clinton factions, suggesting that Biden might replace Kamala Harris with Hillary Clinton to secure party unity and fundraising support. McCormick also claims that Democrats are preparing a strategy involving ballot manipulation to ensure Biden’s re-election.  EJ Antoni criticizes the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for underreporting inflation, arguing that official statistics fail to reflect the real cost of living increases felt by Americans. He highlights discrepancies in health insurance and housing costs, noting that while BLS claims health insurance costs have dropped, real expenses have risen. Antoni also points out that mortgage payments on median-priced homes have surged 117% since Biden took office, contradicting BLS figures. This perceived underreporting makes Americans feel gaslighted as they struggle with higher costs for essentials like food, rent, and utilities. Antoni argues that the Biden administration’s economic messaging is out of touch, as many Americans face financial hardships. He asserts that this disconnect is influencing voting preferences, with the economy becoming a top priority for voters regardless of their political affiliation.  Jeff Clark and Ben Harnwell discussed the impeachment resolutions against Justices Thomas and Alito led by AOC. Clark explained these resolutions aim to intimidate justices and are unlikely to pass, lacking support and legislative viability. He criticized the resolutions as politically motivated attacks to make the justices’ lives difficult. Clark highlighted the resolutions’ sponsorship by prominent leftist House members and dismissed the allegations as baseless. He also shared his contact information and expressed readiness to provide future updates on the situation.  US Rep. Bob Good gave an update about the recount effort for his campaign.  Col. Harvey criticizes Democratic efforts to influence the Supreme Court by attempting to remove justices like Thomas and Alito. The GOP speaker argues that Democrats expect compliance with their agenda regardless of being in or out of power, using AOC’s impeachment resolution as an example. The speaker dismisses the likelihood of these resolutions passing, viewing them as political stunts aimed at intimidating the justices. They also discuss the improbability of such resolutions against judges on similar grounds, emphasizing the perceived abuses of power and political motives behind these actions. The speaker advocates for fair voting and criticizes NATO’s handling of the Ukraine conflict, attributing NATO’s recent vitality to Trump’s policies. </div>
