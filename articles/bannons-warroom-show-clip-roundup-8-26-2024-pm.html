    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 8/26/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Darren Beattie discusses the arrest of Pavel Durov, founder of Telegram, highlighting it as a significant development in the ongoing struggle between free speech advocates and state censorship. Beattie argues that Durov’s arrest on charges such as distributing child pornography and drug trafficking is essentially punitive, aimed at pressuring him to comply with state demands for censorship and information. He sees this as part of a broader escalation by states unable to censor platforms traditionally, moving towards criminalizing speech they oppose. Beattie notes that this trend is also reflected in the U.S., citing the felony charge against Douglas Mackey as another example. He emphasizes the geopolitical implications, particularly with Durov’s efforts to maintain a neutral, privacy-focused platform, suggesting that this has drawn ire from multiple intelligence agencies worldwide. Beattie concludes that the arrest marks a dangerous new phase in the global “censorship wars,” with significant consequences for free speech and geopolitical neutrality.  Robert Malone discusses his political journey, stating he has friends across various political camps, including centrist libertarians and those linked to both Trump and Kennedy. Initially involved in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign, Malone distanced himself after disagreeing with some of Kennedy’s policies. Over time, he became convinced that Trump’s positions align more closely with his own views, particularly regarding free speech and the Second Amendment. He supports Trump unequivocally, believing that Trump’s leadership is essential for America’s future. Additionally, Malone criticizes the updated COVID-19 vaccines, citing insufficient data and potential risks like myocarditis. He argues that regulatory processes are being bypassed and emphasizes the importance of scientific rigor. He also mentions his book, which aims to educate readers on media manipulation and technological tactics used against the public, promoting resilience against such strategies.  Mike Benz discussed how the encrypted messaging app Telegram is used by the U.S. government for international diplomacy and covert operations. He highlighted its role in the 2020 Belarus protests, supported by the U.S. State Department and CIA, to evade state surveillance. Benz also mentioned the U.S. interest in using Telegram to support dissidents in Russia, citing U.S. NGOs’ condemnation when Russia considered banning Telegram in 2018. He suggested that the U.S. attempts to gain access to Telegram’s backend, including efforts to recruit Telegram’s chief engineer. Benz believes Telegram is vital for U.S. intelligence, enabling them to gather information and coordinate activities without leaving federal fingerprints. He implied the recent arrest of Telegram’s founder in France may have been coordinated with the U.S. due to its strategic importance, especially for monitoring Russian communications and propaganda.  Natalie Winters talked about the lack of appropriate behavior by the Biden/Harris administration toward the tragic deaths of 13 members in the Afghanistan withdrawal,  representing the disastrous policies in general by Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.  In their discussion, Joe Allen and Noor Bin Laden express concerns about the transhumanist movement and its implications for individual freedom, highlighting fears of a “collectivist hive mind.” Noor criticizes Elon Musk’s role in advancing technological convergence and his influence on social media, suggesting platforms like X are tools for psychological manipulation. The conversation shifts to a recent World Economic Forum report identifying four global risks in the post-pandemic era: a decline in American dominance, political legitimacy crises, an international mental health crisis, and potential cyber threats. Noor argues that these risks are part of a broader agenda for global control, emphasizing the need for vigilance against misinformation and manipulation. Joe concludes by advising resistance to fear and compliance, urging people to stay informed and retain their humanity amidst these challenges.   In a conversation with Joe Allen, Tim Hinchcliffe discussed a declassified document from the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). The document reveals that the intelligence community seeks cost-effective methods to acquire publicly and commercially available data, bypassing traditional legal constraints like obtaining warrants. Hinchcliffe explained that this practice, normalized over time, allows government and private entities to access and use personal data extensively. He highlighted how smartphones and other digital devices make tracking individuals easier, which raises privacy concerns. Hinchcliffe’s article on this topic, titled “The U.S. Spy Community is Looking for Cheaper, Quicker Ways to Access and Buy Your Data,” is available on his website, Sociable.co. The discussion emphasizes the increasing ease with which personal information is collected and the importance of awareness and potential resistance to such data practices.   </div>
