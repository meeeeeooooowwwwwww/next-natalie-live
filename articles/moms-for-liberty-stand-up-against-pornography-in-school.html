    <h1>Moms For Liberty: Stand Up Against Pornography In School</h1>
    <div>Tina Descovitch leads a delegation from Moms for Liberty to the “War Room” at CPAC in D.C. Joining her were Tia Bass, the new national “spokesmom,” and “Miss Information” (played by our own Natalie Winters!) “We are working to save America, and we do that by unifying, educating and empowering parents to defend their parental rights at all levels of government.”  </div>
