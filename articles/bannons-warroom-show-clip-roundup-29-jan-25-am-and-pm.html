    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 29 Jan 25 [AM and PM]</h1>
    <div>Sen. Rand Paul praises Kennedy as a disruptor in this segment, which is necessary because public health has been mismanaged for years, citing the misleading food pyramid as an example he said. He highlights Kennedy’s breadth of knowledge and his advocacy for transparency and open discussion about medical risks and benefits, especially concerning the COVID-19 vaccine. Paul criticizes the government for not being honest about the vaccine’s risks versus benefits for different age groups, suggesting that the advice given was not tailored to individual risk levels. He points out that the government’s approach, including mandates, misinformation on masks, and social distancing, has led to public distrust. Steve Bannon questions if the misinformation was intentional. Paul responds by suggesting that authorities knew the truth but chose to mislead the public under the guise of a ‘noble lie’, thinking it would benefit society. The conversation shifts to strategies for tackling the influence of Big Pharma. Paul suggests separating pharmaceutical companies from their regulatory influence, using the example of government and pharmaceutical companies sharing patents on the mRNA vaccine. He argues for better transparency to restore trust in government health advice. The discussion ends with Paul promising continued scrutiny over figures like Anthony Fauci, particularly regarding the virus’s origins and the handling of related research, indicating ongoing investigations and a commitment to transparency.  Robert F. Kennedy appeared before a Senate hearing for his nomination by President Trump for Health secretary.  Megyn Kelly joined Steve Bannon to discuss Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s (RFK Jr.) performance at his Senate confirmation hearing. Kelly noted that although the hearing was tough, RFK Jr. handled the situation well despite the aggressive questioning. She remarked that Senator Cassidy particularly challenged him on issues like Medicare and Medicaid, where technical questions were used to make him appear unprepared potentially. However, she felt that RFK Jr. managed to articulate his positions, especially on environmental toxins, which Trump selected him to address. Kelly defended RFK Jr. against accusations of being anti-vaccine, clarifying that he does not advocate for banning vaccines but opposes mandatory vaccinations. She and Bannon then discussed the broader implications of RFK Jr.’s nomination, highlighting the opposition from influential figures like Elizabeth Warren, whom they accused of being financially tied to Big Pharma. Bannon and Kelly also touched on the strategies RFK Jr. could use in future hearings, suggesting he should be more aggressive and capitalize on his strengths, like his litigation experience and knowledge of environmental issues. They emphasized the importance of his nomination in fighting against the influence of Big Pharma, expressing concerns about corruption within regulatory bodies like the FDA. The conversation also veered into personal anecdotes about RFK Jr., including his family dynamics and public persona, with Kelly mentioning his vocal cord issues, which sometimes affected his speaking capabilities. They concluded by discussing the political strategy President Trump should employ to ensure RFK Jr.’s confirmation, suggesting Trump should actively whip votes to support his nominee, given the significance of RFK Jr.’s role in addressing health and environmental issues. The dialogue was punctuated by their mutual support for RFK Jr., despite acknowledging his eccentricities and a shared skepticism of the pharmaceutical industry’s influence over politics and health policy. Part One:  Part Two:  Brian Glenn and Steve Bannon discussed the recent OMB memo, its media reception, and broader political strategies. Bannon noted that the memo, while standard, triggered a firestorm from the left. Glenn highlighted Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt’s firm response, dismissing media narratives about funding cuts to critical programs, reinforcing her no-nonsense approach. Bannon questioned whether the administration showed weakness, but Glenn assured that Trump’s team remains aggressive, with daily briefings from either Leavitt or Trump himself. Glenn also noted that experienced White House reporters had never seen such direct responses from an administration. Looking ahead, they emphasized the urgency of aligning the House with Trump’s agenda, as policy battles over debt, deficits, and taxes loom. Bannon stressed that process—not just policy—is crucial, given constitutional constraints on spending. Trump’s actions, including moves on immigration and reallocating unspent Green New Deal funds, were framed as bold, demonstrating executive authority. Glenn highlighted Trump’s direct approach with foreign governments on deportation, reinforcing his tough stance. Bannon concluded that Trump is "winning everywhere” but warned against strategic missteps that could hand the opposition a rallying point. He emphasized that this is a "testing period” for aggressive governance, urging continued momentum without hesitation.  Steve Bannon talked about the action steps needed to help secure the nomination of President Trump.  Mary Holland talked about the MAHA movement of supporters behind Robert Kennedy Jr.  Kari Lake talked to Steve Bannon about the “mama bear” movement behind Robert Kennedy Jr and why she supports his nomination.  Lake also shared the perspective of the Moms who feel betrayed by the food and medical industry.  Lake thought he Kennedy did very well and predicted he will be nominated.  Natalie WInters gave a live report from the White House.  Jim Rickards talked about President Trump’s numerous executive actions since getting sworn in.  Steve Bannon talked to George Papadopoulos and his wife, Simona Mangiante about their new podcast.  </div>
