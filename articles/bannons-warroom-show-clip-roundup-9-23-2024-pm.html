    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 9/23/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Rep. Tim Burchett discussed the belief that President Trump’s return to Washington is the only thing that can save the United States at this point because the House and Senate are so divided and unwilling to separate themselves from the centralized power of the established order there.  Natalie Winters talked about her feelings over Mike Turner’s social media, where he made critical remarks about Donald Trump.  Noor Bin Ladin talked about the background of the United Nations and talked about what she expected was going to come out of the General Assembly there in New Yorl.   Adam Wren talked about his 6 month investigation into the life of Mike Davis and some of the foundation of his reporting on Davis and Article 3 Project for Politico.  Mike Davis and Andrew Ferguson discuss Ferguson’s background and achievements, highlighting his key roles in confirming Justices Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, transforming the federal judiciary during the Trump administration. Ferguson, formerly the Solicitor General of Virginia, now serves as a Republican commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission, where he led major antitrust actions, particularly against Google. The conversation centers on Ferguson’s admiration for Justice Clarence Thomas, emphasizing Thomas’ resilience against ongoing progressive attacks and his unwavering commitment to constitutional principles. Ferguson also reflects on Trump’s judicial appointments, underscoring the importance of selecting judges with strong backbones to withstand leftist pressure. Both agree that Trump’s second term should focus on appointing more originalist judges willing to stand firm under scrutiny, especially regarding critical issues like race, religious liberty, and free speech.  In this discussion, Mike Davis interviews Jeff Clark, a former top Justice Department official under Trump, about the legal and political persecution he has faced. Clark details how he was targeted for providing legal advice on the 2020 election and investigations into election irregularities. He explained how Attorney General Barr had shut down the investigations he had recommended. Clark recounts being smeared by the media, targeted by congressional committees, and having his home raided by the Justice Department. He discusses his involvement in cases led by Fani Willis and Jack Smith, and the implications of the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity decision. Clark argues that these legal battles represent political persecution, particularly for the defendants on January 6, and calls for consequences for the misuse of justice. </div>
