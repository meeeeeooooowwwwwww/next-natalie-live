    <h1>Bannon & Winters React To NYT Labeling War Room As #1 Show For Spreading 'Misinformation.'</h1>
    <div>Steve Bannon and executive editor Natalie Winters celebrate being named the No. 1 show in the country for spreading misinformation by the New York Times. Of course, Bannon puts it in perspective, considering the source! “The New York Times, this morning, … has deemed your show, “War Room”, No. 1 in the nation as far as correct information about what reality is… By the way, the CCP-owned and -operated Brooking Institute did a study… they said 20 percent of our podcast has misinformation about the vax, about Ukraine… War Room will always be No. 1 as far as accurate information about reality!”  </div>
