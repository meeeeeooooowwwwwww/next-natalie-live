    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 1/2/2025 [PM]</h1>
    <div>In this discussion between Ben Bergquam and Steve Bannon, they addressed the ongoing challenges at the U.S.-Mexico border and broader societal implications. Bergquam described his recent observations in San Diego, highlighting the surge of illegal immigrants, sanctuary policies protecting them, and organizations like Catholic Charities facilitating their entry. He criticized what he called the “illegal alien industrial complex,” alleging that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international entities profit from these activities while undermining American sovereignty. Bergquam linked the border crisis to a broader agenda, claiming it paves the way for domestic destabilization, including potential terror attacks and civil unrest similar to past events like the George Floyd riots. He warned of pre-positioning efforts by NGOs and complicit media to resist immigration reforms under a future Trump administration, despite the November 5th election results signaling public demand for change. Bannon emphasized that modern politics has evolved into a form of warfare, where systemic resistance to MAGA policies persists regardless of electoral outcomes. Both discussed the need for defunding and prosecuting organizations collaborating with cartels or undermining U.S. laws. They urged vigilance against what they described as a deliberate effort to create chaos and render illegal immigration permanent. The conversation highlighted concerns about national security, the weaponization of government apparatuses, and the erosion of public trust in institutions, framing these issues as part of a larger battle over America’s future.  Steve Bannon and Ava Chen discussed the current state of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under Xi Jinping’s leadership, analyzing Xi’s New Year’s message and its implications. Bannon highlighted Xi’s declaration that Taiwan is a province of China and his warnings against foreign interference. Chen described the dire state of China’s economy, worsening living conditions, and growing resistance to the CCP, noting these signs of desperation could lead to extreme measures. Chen pointed out Xi’s increased control over Macau and Hong Kong, emphasizing the CCP’s use of threats against Taiwan. She connected current events to past warnings, such as the U.S.-China trade talks in 2019, where Xi’s regime allegedly hinted at opening a "Pandora’s box,” later linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. She outlined the CCP’s strategy, including economic manipulation, cyberattacks, and propaganda, aimed at destabilizing the West. Bannon and Chen warned of the CCP’s collaboration with Russia in escalating conflicts, such as the Ukraine invasion, and its long-term agenda against the U.S. Chen underscored the importance of exposing the CCP’s tactics through independent media like the New Federal State TV, calling for vigilance against these threats.  Steve Bannon and Brian Kennedy discussed the resilience of the American people in defending their nation and the challenges posed by the “dark enlightenment” narrative. Kennedy dismissed claims that Americans lack the morality and energy to preserve their civilization, citing grassroots efforts and the Trump movement as proof of their resolve. He emphasized the need to dismantle the administrative and Deep State, aligning with Trump’s vision for governance. The discussion contrasted this belief in self-governance with the technocratic, post-national ideologies promoted by figures like Elon Musk, who envision a future detached from the U.S. Constitution and sovereignty.  Steve Bannon and Ben Harnwell discussed tensions within the MAGA movement, focusing on H1B visas and their impact on American workers. Harnwell argued that the movement, rooted in working-class support, faces challenges from billionaire elites pushing for policies like expansive immigration reform. He called for loyalty to President Trump while holding him accountable when necessary. Bannon emphasized unwavering support for American workers, advocating a total moratorium on immigration, legal or otherwise, citing concerns over abuses in programs like H1B. Both criticized President Trump’s promotion of a Boston Globe editorial, noting the publication’s anti-MAGA stance. They resolved to stay aligned with MAGA’s foundational principles, rejecting corporate and elite influences.  Natalie Winters talks about the state of employment in the United States and gives updates on the recent national controversy with the H-1B Visa debate. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Will Upton talks about his research into the Dignity Act.  </div>
