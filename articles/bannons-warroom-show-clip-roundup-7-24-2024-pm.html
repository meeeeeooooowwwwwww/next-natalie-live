    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 7/24/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Brian Glenn opened live from the Bonjangles convention center in Charlotte, North Carolina, with live remarks from rally attendees. Part One:  Part Two of the WarRoom opening includes remarks about the conditions of the Southern Border under Democrat Joe Biden with Kamala Harris as the “Border Czar,” pointing to no change in policy for the American people from the Democrat border policies.  Part Three of the WarRoom live open from the Trump rally in North Carolina:  Max Matheu criticized the Biden administration’s alleged attempts to manipulate elections, arguing that they are using taxpayer dollars to fund voter registration efforts in Native American communities as part of a strategy to influence the 2024 election. He described this as an overhaul of the federal election system, claiming that the Democrats aim to create new voters in key areas to gain an advantage. Matheu also pointed out that federal agencies may not have the authority to conduct these registration efforts, as even ethics attorneys have raised doubts. He urged supporters to stay informed through Heritage Oversight’s social media channels.  In this segment, Max Metheu highlighted concerns about the Secret Service’s handling of phone records related to investigations, stressing the need for transparency and accountability. He criticized the potential loss or mismanagement of these records, arguing that a special or select committee must have the authority to obtain and scrutinize them. Metheu stated that the failure to properly maintain and provide access to phone records indicates a broader issue of systemic corruption within federal agencies, emphasizing that these agencies are not fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities. This lack of transparency, he suggests, is part of the “business as usual” approach that allows key information to be swept under the rug, hindering genuine investigation efforts and enabling political manipulation. He further implied that phone records could reveal significant insights into the actions and communications of key figures during critical moments, and their proper examination is essential for uncovering any misconduct or unethical behavior. Metheu insists that only through a special commission with comprehensive investigatory powers can there be a legitimate attempt to address these issues and prevent future occurrences.  In the discussion between Natalie Winters and Julie Kelly, Kelly offers a critical perspective on FBI Director Christopher Wray’s testimony regarding the January 6th events. She expresses skepticism about Wray’s ability to provide a fair assessment, describing the FBI as “hopelessly corrupt, partisan, and political” under his leadership. Kelly emphasizes the lack of accountability for the construction of the gallows on Capitol grounds, a key symbol of the January 6th insurrection. Despite over three and a half years having passed, she notes that “no one has been identified with constructing those gallows,” highlighting the FBI’s failure to address this aspect of the investigation. Kelly also critiques the FBI’s handling of confidential human sources (CHSs) during the January 6th events. She mentions that during the Proud Boys trial, the DOJ admitted to having 8 to 9 CHSs embedded in the group, but suggests the actual number may have been higher. Furthermore, Kelly references an impending DOJ Inspector General report, which is expected to reveal details about the FBI’s role and the number of informants involved in January 6th. She anticipates this report will be “pretty explosive” and could shed light on the FBI’s activities during that period, questioning whether DOJ officials are delaying its release. </div>
