    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 9/24/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Natalie Winters talks about her disappointment in Speaker Mike Johnson.  Russ Vought warns that moving into a lame-duck session could lead to an omnibus bill, typically rushed after elections and leading to poor policies. He criticizes this process, arguing that it results in massive, unreadable bills passed hastily, and urges Republicans to resist. Vought is concerned that such a bill would fund “woke” federal programs at high levels, undermining potential future efforts by a second Trump administration. He stresses that Republicans should minimize support for the bill, pushing Hakeem Jeffries to carry it. Despite Speaker Johnson’s opposition to large omnibus bills, Vought believes institutional pressures will likely lead to large, hurried bills like in the past. He also refutes fears of a government shutdown, claiming shutdowns often benefit Republicans politically by showing their commitment to their policy objectives and criticizes Washington D.C.’s reluctance to engage in such brinkmanship.  Ed Dowd highlights that economic downturns typically manifest 18 months after policy changes, which are now evident in 2023. He notes a looming commercial real estate crisis and rising credit risks, with no bailout likely. Government hiring and illegal immigration have temporarily buoyed the economy, but this support is fading. He points to the U.S. housing market, where home prices are at an all-time high compared to household income, and investors are buying up lower-priced homes. Dowd suggests easing red tape to build more housing, which could help alleviate the housing crisis, but warns it will take time to see effects.  Mike Benz discusses a letter revealing threats and actions taken by U.S. government agencies, including the FBI and the Justice Department, against individuals. He mentions concerns about withholding information, particularly a manifesto, due to fears of misinformation spreading online. Benz highlights the case of an individual with a long criminal history, protected by authorities despite numerous arrests and an assassination attempt. He suggests possible ties between this person’s wife and the U.S. defense industry, particularly Maximus Corporation, which works with the Department of Defense. Benz questions the wife’s financial backing of activities related to Ukraine recruitment. He also links the defense establishment to efforts against former President Trump, citing multiple national security officials who have opposed Trump since his campaign. Benz implies that the defense sector has played a significant role in attempts to undermine Trump’s presidency, and he raises concerns about censorship and media manipulation in these efforts.  This conversation is a call to action, emphasizing the urgency of getting involved in the 2024 elections. The host, Alex, guest-hosting for Steve Bannon on War Room Battleground, urges listeners to start volunteering now, whether by supporting a candidate or addressing key ballot issues. With 42 days until the election, the message is clear: it’s time for all hands on deck, as early voting is underway in key battleground states. Alex reports that Donald Trump is ramping up his campaign events, focusing on battleground states like Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, with plans to expand efforts nationwide, including red states like Alabama and swing states like Minnesota and Maine. The discussion touches on Trump’s policy issues, such as preventing foreign control of American farmland and addressing immigration crises, particularly the impact of Haitian and Venezuelan migrants. Trump is running a 50-state strategy, leveraging union dissatisfaction (notably from the Teamsters) and seeing favorable polling in Rust Belt and Sunbelt states. The message also highlights the importance of “ballot chasing” – ensuring that Republican voters return their ballots at a higher rate than Democrats. Volunteers are encouraged to get lists of voters with outstanding ballots and make calls to increase turnout. The conversation underscores that Trump has multiple pathways to securing the 270 electoral votes, with critical support from Senate races and strong grassroots operations. The overarching theme is mobilizing Trump supporters to take action immediately to secure victory in the upcoming election. Part ONE:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Grace Chong talked about the BillBlaster app and emphasized the importance of early voting. She highlighted her efforts by texting and calling voters, particularly in Pennsylvania, from her home in California. Chong also mentioned how crucial it is to get low-propensity voters engaged, noting that early voting helps prevent last-minute issues, citing an example of her mother in 2012, who couldn’t vote due to an accident. Chong stressed the significance of the BillBlaster app, urging people to call their representatives regarding House Resolution 1305, a bill aimed at supporting Steve Bannon. She emphasized the need to get 218 signatures for a discharge petition and encouraged supporters to push daily for this. According to Chong, early voting and using tools like BillBlaster can make a substantial impact, and she urged Bannon’s “Posse” to show their support for him and his causes through these platforms. </div>
