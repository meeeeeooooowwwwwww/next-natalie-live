    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 10/31/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Steve Bannon and Chris Buskirk discussed turnout efforts in the upcoming election, focusing on mobilizing low and mid-propensity voters who already support Donald Trump but may not have a strong voting history. Their campaign strategy relies on new FEC rules that allow outside groups, like Turnout for America, to collaborate with campaign data, enabling a targeted approach without duplication of effort. This is seen as a game-changer, especially given limited resources. Buskirk explained that their strategy is data-driven, using information on voters’ prior turnout behavior to pinpoint and engage potential supporters. So far, this has proven effective in swing states, with early voting participation reportedly surpassing 2016 and 2020 rates among Trump supporters. Additionally, Bannon and Buskirk contrasted their approach with the Democrats’, who are also trying to mobilize their base but appear to lack enthusiasm among their low-propensity voters. Buskirk emphasized that their success hinges on grassroots efforts and adapting to early voting, a shift from prior GOP habits. The overall message was that this new approach is making a measurable impact on voter engagement, which they believe is crucial to achieving victory  Natalie Winters talked about her investigation into the connections between the Arizona Secretary of State and the person she calls the Colour Revolution Architect.  In this conversation, Caroline Wren and Steve Bannon discuss the high voter turnout among Republicans in Arizona, where GOP early voting has taken a significant lead. Wren attributes this surge to discontent with current administration policies and to grassroots organizing led by Bannon’s "War Room Posse.” She highlights that these efforts have activated local GOP chapters, especially in Arizona, driving a strong turnout. Wren and Bannon then discuss Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake’s polling lead over her Democratic opponents, contrasting this with the lack of support from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. They also cover a recent legal development concerning unverified voters in Arizona: a court ruling mandated the release of information on nearly 289,000 voters whose citizenship status was unconfirmed. However, despite America First Legal’s legal victory, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled these individuals cannot be removed from voting rolls. Concerns over potential voter suppression due to long wait times at mass voting centers in Maricopa County were raised, with Wren advising voters to stay in line to ensure their votes are counted.  Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon addressed the economic struggles faced by working-class Americans, citing inflation, rising credit card debt, and high-interest rates. According to Navarro, middle and lower-income Americans are burdened by steep credit card APRs, which reach up to 29%, forcing them into debt for basic necessities. The cost of living is rising, especially with essentials like food and housing, and people are increasingly using credit cards just to get by. Navarro noted that many are “choosing between food on the table and medicine in the cabinet,” and inflation only compounds these issues. They attribute much of this economic stress to what they call “politician error,” arguing that Federal Reserve policies and high interest rates are worsening inflation and mortgage costs. Bannon pointed out that when Trump left office, the ten-year treasury rate was under 1%, but it has since risen, affecting loan rates and economic stability. The two argue that these economic challenges have led working-class Americans to support Trump’s policies, believing his tenure offered better conditions, including tariffs on steel and aluminum to protect U.S. industries. Navarro cited Trump’s actions as beneficial for American manufacturing and job security, especially in areas like Pennsylvania, where industries benefited from protective tariffs. Navarro urged voters to show up in large numbers in the next election to ensure the outcomes reflect public sentiment, emphasizing Trump’s “100 actions in 100 days” if re-elected.  In a conversation with Steve Bannon, Sigal Chattah emphasized the significant strides Republicans have made in Nevada, describing efforts to dismantle the longstanding Democratic "Harry Reid machine” and indicating a promising lead in Republican votes. She highlighted a current 40,000 Republican vote advantage, noting that this lead surpasses Trump’s 2020 loss margin in the state, suggesting potential for a Trump victory in 2024. Chattah discussed extensive ballot-harvesting strategies, including creative initiatives like using Halloween gatherings as opportunities for ballot collection. She explained that early voting was still underway, and efforts to "bank ballots” would continue through Election Day, enabled by Nevada’s 2020 decision to decriminalize ballot harvesting. Bannon praised Chattah and her team’s mobilization and commended their commitment to converting Nevada for Trump. They briefly discussed media attention on Chattah as a potential attorney general pick and the strategy to prioritize securing both the presidency and Congress. Bannon also encouraged followers to stay updated on Chattah’s efforts through her social media. Chattah expressed confidence in delivering Nevada to Trump, citing support from various groups and a well-coordinated ballot-chasing operation.  Natalie Winters talked about how the admin state and the corporate media are pushing for an amendment to the US Constutition in order to stop President Trump from returning to the White House.  In this conversation, Steve Bannon and Jeff Clark discuss the legal and political complexities surrounding efforts to prevent Donald Trump from assuming office if re-elected, focusing on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars those who engaged in insurrection from holding office. They highlight a recent Supreme Court decision in Colorado rejecting attempts to remove Trump from the ballot. Clark explains that the justices upheld Trump’s eligibility because barring a presidential candidate in one state could lead to chaos, resulting in inconsistent ballots across states. However, Clark notes that while the ruling was unanimous in Trump’s favor on this basis, the justices were split on broader questions, such as the enforceability of Section 3 and whether a new statute is needed to apply it. Bannon and Clark speculate on Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin’s possible maneuvers, particularly his suggestion that Congress might refuse to certify Trump’s presidency on January 6, 2025, if he is labeled an insurrectionist. This, they argue, could trigger an emergency Supreme Court case. Clark is concerned about potential further indictments from Special Counsel Jack Smith and how these might be leveraged in January if Democrats, led by Hakeem Jeffries in the House, attempt to block Trump. Clark also raises concerns about potential abuses in the voting process, particularly through the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), which he claims could be exploited due to lenient residency requirements. Both Bannon and Clark underscore the significance of these legal strategies, arguing that figures like Mark Elias and Raskin are determined to prevent Trump from regaining power through judicial and legislative tactics.  Part Two:  Grace Chong commends the resilience and dedication of the WarRoom audience, supporters who rallied together following the incarceration of Steve Bannon. She describes his imprisonment as a "blessing in disguise,” igniting a sense of urgency and action among the group. Chong encourages continued participation, particularly in support of Joe Kent’s congressional race in Washington’s third district, emphasizing the importance of sending postcards and verifying ballot statuses due to potential issues with mail-in ballots. The recent fire in Clark County, which may have compromised hundreds of ballots, highlights the need for voters to ensure their ballots are accepted. Chong praises JoJo, a key leader in the effort, as well as the team members who kept operations running smoothly. As early voting comes to a close, she underscores the importance of persistence and determination, anticipating potential challenges at the polls. She stresses the need for unity and readiness, urging supporters to press forward through Election Day to achieve victory, which can then be leveraged by allies like Boris Epstein, Jeff Clark, Bill McGinley, and Mike Davis in ongoing efforts. </div>
