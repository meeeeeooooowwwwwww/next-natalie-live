    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 10/15/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>VIDEO Natalie WInters talked about how the government elite are using an excuse of misinformation being spread on social media to censor people’s speech online. VIDEO VIDEO Jeremy Carl is an author has believes that President Trump needs to be more aggressive in getting the “White vote” claiming that Trump has not focused on White voters. VIDEO Darren Beattie talked about the MacArthur Fellowship awards being given to people for exhibiting radical far-leftist ideology, including DEI. VIDEO Daily Mail correspondent Katelynn Richardson talked about her latest article that exposes the pressure on parents to affirm their children’s transgender ideas. VIDEO Natalie Winters played a video of Rachel Madow reacting to the Vanity Fair article from last week focusing on Steve Bannon.  Winters reacted and said that people should be more like Steve Bannon than Rachel Maddow. VIDEO Lance Wallnau and Dave Brat delivered powerful messages about the intersection of faith and politics. Wallnau highlighted the importance of Christian civic engagement, recounting a recent event at the National Mall where a quarter of a million people gathered, joined by millions online. He stressed, "There is a movement of Awakening that’s happening,” urging pastors to encourage their congregations to vote, lamenting that "31 million evangelicals will sit out the election” due to pastoral reluctance to address political issues. He argued that encouraging just five million votes could make a difference. Wallnau criticized the media for demonizing Christian involvement in politics, particularly their support for Donald Trump. He also emphasized that Christian values align with political action, drawing from Biblical examples like Daniel’s involvement in political affairs under King Cyrus. "If our angel is supporting a heathen… how much more can we stand with Donald Trump?” Wallnau remarked. Dave Brat expanded on this, addressing the theological misconception that Christians should avoid politics. He called this mindset "bad theology,” noting how America’s prosperity allows for such disengagement. Brat reminded listeners of the founding principles rooted in Christianity, adding that early American institutions like Harvard were steeped in religious ideals. Both Wallnau and Brat argued that the separation of church and state is misunderstood, and that Christian engagement is crucial to preserving the nation’s values. VIDEO Steve Soukup argues that corporations, driven by powerful asset management firms like BlackRock, are prioritizing political agendas over their fiduciary responsibilities to investors. He describes this as “unfair” to people who simply want to invest for retirement or run their businesses without political interference. Soukup highlights how companies are pressured to focus on issues like climate change and diversity, which he believes are secondary to investor returns. He points to the influence of asset management giants—BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard—collectively managing over $20 trillion. These firms, Soukup claims, decide how businesses should operate based on politics rather than financial priorities. “Larry Fink is the most powerful man in the world,” Soukup asserts, criticizing Fink for using clients’ money to advance political agendas. To counter this trend, Soukup emphasizes the need for grassroots action. He suggests building smaller, independent institutions that resist the influence of large asset managers. Soukup believes that only a "revolution from beneath,” inspired by the principles of America’s founders, can reverse the trend. He calls for an awakening in the financial services world to ensure businesses focus on their core mission of serving investors, not politics. VIDEO Mark Paoletta and Dave Brat highlighted the deep state’s overreach and its impact on everyday Americans. Paoletta emphasized the 33rd anniversary of Justice Clarence Thomas’s confirmation, noting his importance in standing up against “the left’s vicious attacks.” He praised both Thomas and Justice Neil Gorsuch for their strong stance on protecting individuals from the overwhelming number of laws and regulations, which Paoletta called a “blizzard of laws…designed to trip you up.” Paoletta discussed Gorsuch’s focus on how bureaucratic overreach affects ordinary people, referencing a fisherman prosecuted under corporate law for throwing fish back into the water, which “destroyed his life.” He criticized the left’s attempts to discredit conservative justices, particularly Gorsuch and Thomas, and underscored the significance of elections in shaping the Supreme Court. With Election Day approaching, Paoletta stressed that “President Trump is winning” and that voters must respond to the “lies on social media” by supporting Trump’s agenda to “secure our border” and “stamp out violent crime.” He concluded by calling the upcoming election “the most important of our lifetime” and expressed confidence that Trump would win comfortably. VIDEO Grace Chong talked about the process of ballot chasing and said that Steve Bannon sent a message from prison that he wants everyone to work like they are 10 points down.</div>
