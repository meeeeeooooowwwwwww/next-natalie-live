    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 31 Jan 25 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Jack Posobiec and Steve Bannon discussed the details of Tulsi Gabbard’s confirmation hearing.  Kassam Raheem talked to Steve Bannon about the breaking details of the news that President Trump had fired some FBI agents.  Julie Kelly and Steve Bannon discuss a major shakeup within the FBI and DOJ, describing it as a long-overdue purge of entrenched bureaucrats obstructing reform. Kelly highlights how DOJ officials were in shock after Trump’s victory, knowing their actions would come under scrutiny. She mentions that Kash Patel will play a key role in investigating and holding corrupt officials accountable, now facing fewer barriers in accessing critical evidence. They expect fierce pushback, with critics framing these actions as retaliation against career civil servants, but argue the real goal is to restore integrity by removing political bias. Kelly also discusses broader DOJ reforms, including a new focus on actual national security threats instead of politically driven prosecutions. She highlights efforts to reassign corrupt prosecutors to neutral roles, forcing some to resign rather than enforce immigration laws. Additionally, an internal inquiry has been launched into controversial charges used against January 6 defendants, particularly after a Supreme Court ruling reversed key legal precedents. The restructuring extends to federal attorneys, with new leadership prioritizing immigration enforcement. Kelly emphasizes that these moves mark a major step toward dismantling corruption within the DOJ and FBI, with more changes expected soon.  Phillip Patrick and Steve Bannon discussed major economic and political shifts under a potential second Trump presidency. Patrick emphasized tariffs as a tool to balance trade deficits, suggesting a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican goods and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports, generating up to $820 billion annually. However, he acknowledged tariffs raise consumer prices and can trigger retaliatory measures, as seen in 2016, which impacted American farmers. Despite these drawbacks, tariffs have spurred U.S. manufacturing, with factory construction rising 250% since Trump’s initial tariffs on China. Patrick warned that tariffs alone wouldn’t close the deficit and that deficit spending remains a challenge.  Steve Bannon and Mike Davis discussed the critical need for conservative action in judicial confirmations and government spending. Davis emphasized mobilizing citizens to pressure senators into confirming President Trump’s cabinet picks, warning against GOP obstruction. Bannon reinforced that MAGA supporters will not tolerate resistance from Senate Republicans.  Natalie Winters gave her report from the White House. </div>
