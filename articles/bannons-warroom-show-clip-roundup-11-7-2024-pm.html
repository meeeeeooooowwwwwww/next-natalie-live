    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 11/7/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Natalie Winters discusses a report that shows illegal immigrants are going to surge at the US’s open borders.  Oscar El Blue Ramirez, a correspondent for Real America’s Voice, discussed the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border in the context of shifting immigration policies and the 2024 election. He described a recent surge in migrants, with a caravan of over 3,000 people arriving on Election Day. Many migrants believed Kamala Harris would win, making it easier to enter the U.S., but the prospect of Trump’s stricter policies has led some to reconsider or return home. Ramirez noted that the Biden administration’s CBP One app, which allows migrants to apply for asylum from within Mexico, has seen increased use. He mentioned that many migrants now come from diverse regions, including Central and South America, the Middle East, and South Asia. According to Ramirez, organized crime, including cartels, profits from the migration surge by charging migrants for assistance in crossing into the U.S. through Guatemala and Mexico. He also accused international organizations of encouraging migrants to enter before Trump possibly returns to office. He criticized Biden’s administration for financially supporting Mexican NGOs and facilities that, he claims, facilitate migration. Ramirez argued that the U.S. should stop federal grants to these NGOs, which he believes operate as proxies, complicating border security efforts. He warned that mass deportations under a potential Trump administration could lead to protests and chaos at the border, with organized crime and activist groups involved in exploiting the crisis.  Steve Bannon highlighted that "personnel is policy,” underscoring the critical role of staffing for a future Trump administration. He believes that top White House staff should be announced immediately to set a decisive tone. Bannon argues that prompt, careful selection will be crucial, particularly in light of what he perceives as previous failures in staffing and policy implementation. Bannon criticized figures like Jeff Miller, a lobbyist closely tied to Kevin McCarthy, whom he blames for the “disastrous debt ceiling deal” and the out-of-control spending that followed. Miller, in Bannon’s view, represents corporate interests—especially in areas like immigration reform, favoring cheap labor policies that align with Wall Street and Silicon Valley. Bannon suggests Miller is deeply connected with major corporate clients and is lobbying within Trump’s orbit, which he sees as a potential problem. To counter this influence, Bannon advocates for staffing that reflects “populist principles.” He supports figures like Susie Wiles, who, despite her reserved style, has proven effective and steady in past campaigns. Ultimately, Bannon asserts that a solid, aligned team will be essential for Trump’s policies to succeed and appeal to the expanding coalition of American citizens seeking real change.   Steve Bannon and Alex DeGrasse discussed the status of Republican control in the House and the Senate, highlighting both the importance of current seats and the role of outstanding races in securing a GOP majority. DeGrasse noted that the Associated Press has called 209 seats for Republicans, with 219 needed for a majority, and confidently projected that Republicans would secure at least 219 with expected wins in several key races. "The Associated Press will call them soon,” he said, referring to GOP-leaning districts in Arizona, California, Nebraska, and Washington that he believes will solidify the count. DeGrasse also emphasized ongoing efforts in key battleground states, pointing to close races in California and Colorado that could raise the GOP seat count to 221. He highlighted the tight race in Colorado’s Aurora district, an area significant to the MAGA movement, where Republicans hold a slight lead. Bannon and DeGrasse were optimistic but cautious about potential surprises in tight races, especially in states like California. Bannon framed the situation as part of a larger battle, with the GOP needing to hold the House to prevent Democrats from using it as a tool "to bring down MAGA and President Trump.” DeGrasse expressed confidence, saying that the GOP could reach up to 222 seats in a best-case scenario, depending on final vote counts and outcomes in toss-up districts.  Natalie Winters explains the weaponization of the Institutions by the Democrats who abused their power against President Trump’s movement , his family and himself. </div>
