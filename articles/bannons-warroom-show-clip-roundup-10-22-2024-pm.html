    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 10/22/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Salleigh Grubbs highlighted growing momentum for Donald Trump, emphasizing high voter turnout in recent elections and record-breaking participation, particularly among lower-propensity Republican voters. Despite not having specific early voting data, Grubbs noted that feedback from poll watchers across Cobb County has been positive, suggesting strong Republican performance. Grubbs shifted focus to ongoing legal challenges in Georgia, mentioning over 85 cases against the Secretary of State. A significant case involves Eternal Vigilance Action, targeting seven rules passed by the Georgia State Election Board. A recent ruling by Judge Cox in Fulton County blocked these rules, potentially impacting the upcoming election. Grubbs emphasized the importance of these rules, specifically those related to ballot counting, which the opposition sought to eliminate. She stressed that the opposition claims to be Republican but acts against what she considers "common-sense” rules. In response, the Georgia GOP and the RNC filed an appeal, with Grubbs submitting a strong amicus brief. She expressed hope that the Supreme Court will issue an expedited, favorable ruling to ensure these election rules are reinstated. Grubbs called for persistence, urging supporters to continue the legal battle to secure fair election processes in Georgia.  Natalie Winters talked about her feelings about Liz Cheney.  Maureen Bannon discusses the details of the First Step Act request filed by her Dad’s legal team in August that was denied just recently. She repeats her story from yesterday about her frustrations over the Bureau of Prison’s denial. Steve Bannon is still scheduled to be released from prison on Oct. 29.  Jim Hoft gives updates on his stories about Overseas Voting, which is being fact-checked by the same organization that Natalie Winters is being fact-checked for, which she says she broke on the WarRoom program a couple of weeks ago, and they share those details.  Mike Davis repeats his story about President Trump’s need to start a criminal probe as soon as possible into the tactics and actions of the administrative state and the Intelligence community.  Ben Harnwell interviewed Michelle Morrow, who is running for office in North Carolina.  Erin Joyce discusses the election in Virginia and her observations on low-propensity voters there. She says it looks good for Trump and other down-ballot races.  Sabin Howard is a Populist Artist who has discussed the history of sculptures and art in the United States. He recently finished a long-term project on World War One. Howard has a unique philosophy about power in art and the need to return to the tenets of Western Civilization in culture and art.  Brandon Showalter and Ben Harnwell’s discussion focuses on the spiritual and moral battles they perceive in current events, both globally and in the U.S. Showalter highlights a “stark contrast between spiritual evil and good,” citing recent public displays he views as demonic, including a controversial event in Georgia and the 2024 Olympics in France, which he believes mocked Christian symbols. He references Biblical teachings on spiritual warfare, emphasizing the power of Christian prayer to combat such perceived evil. Harnwell adds context with a legal battle in Alabama. He explains that the state’s restrictions on gender-affirming treatments for minors have reached the Supreme Court. Alabama’s law, one of the strictest, criminalizes certain medical procedures for children, and the ensuing legal disputes have uncovered what Showalter describes as disturbing activism within influential health organizations, including allegations involving Rachel Levine at the Department of Health and Human Services. The discovery phase has revealed the involvement of prominent activists in shaping healthcare guidelines, further fueling the controversy. Both Showalter and Harnwell underscore the intensity of the moral and political conflicts, with a particular emphasis on prayer and legal measures as means to uphold their views of Christian values. </div>
