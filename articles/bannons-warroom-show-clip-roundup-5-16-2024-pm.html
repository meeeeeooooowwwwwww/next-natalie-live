Reccomended Reading: COVID 19 Transcript Collins-Mentioned in Natalie Winters segment Biden has become detached from economic reality-Chris Talgo segment Full show in segments: Andrew Giuliani and Jeff Clark reported live from the courthouse in New York City, where President Donald Trump’s trial is lingering. They shared their findings about the day and discussed some of the testimony they heard on a busy court day. Michael Cohen testified against Trump and was slammed by Trump’s defenders for lying.  Dr. Seb Gorka talked to Steve Bannon about the audacity of the Biden administration claiming executive Privilege over conversations that Democrat Joe Biden had that likely could have criminal implications for him, which Biden is now using Merrick Garland to cover up for it,  it appears. Garland faces a potential contempt of Congress charge for not answering them in a criminal probe. Gorka hits on the irony of Garland’s actions.  Natalie Winters talked to Steve Bannon about a new COVID-19 report on the associations with Big Pharma to the Chinese Communist Party and the implications for public health.  Talked about deals for the WarRoom audience.  Joe Allen discussed the significance of what he called a Demonic portrait of King Charles. He was joined by Steve Bannon and Ben Harnwell, who shared their reactions to Joe’s discovery.  Jeremy Tedesco talked about the process of debunking and some evidence from his clients of how they are treated.  Tedesco offers a service to people who have been turned out of their bank over religion or politics.  Ben Harnwell talked to Steve Bannon about European news. He was focused on a story about the Slovak Premier who predicted his own attempted assassination a little over a month ago.   News hit this week that the Premier was a target of an assassination, which has shaken the world of Populist politics.  Chris Talgo wrote an article on economics that Steve Bannon has referred to for a few days, a good piece on Biden’s economics and the reality of how Biden’s policies have impacted real Americans.  Josh Hanna talked about his patriot tax service and how he helps Americans with their tax debt.  Steve Bannon encouraged the audience not to let themselves be overwhelmed with worry about tax problems but to ask Hanna for help.   This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, “Action, Action, Action,” as  Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) "I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said, adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: "This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the "Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. "I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn, Posse. Take action and be a part of your nation’s history.  </div>
