Additionally, the administration is expanding efforts to process refugees and economic migrants through migrant centers in Latin America and the Middle East. Concerns about voter registration for non-citizens and potential voter fraud have been raised, with some reports suggesting illegal immigrants are being encouraged to register to vote. Policy changes like reinstating the Remain in Mexico policy and the third country policy are proposed to address illegal immigration. Skepticism about some reports on voter fraud involving non-citizens is expressed, emphasizing it is unlawful to vote unless eligible, and hopes for better enforcement to deter such activities.

Eva Vlaar has received 50 million views on a speech she gave from CPAC in Hungary. In it, she discussed the issues of mass migration and crime in Europe, highlighting incidents and statistics that suggest an increase in crime rates due to immigration. She criticized the European Union and globalist leaders for allowing the “great replacement” of the native European population, arguing that the native population is outnumbered in major cities. Vlaar advocates for a strong Christian Europe of sovereign nation-states and calls for the destruction of the European Union, which they view as a totalitarian institution.  "In our movement, the Citizen comes first” -Steve Bannon This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, “Action, Action, Action,” as  Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) "I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said, adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: "This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the "Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. "I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn Posse.. go do some action and be a part of your own nation’s history.  </div>
