    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 10/16/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Natalie Winters discredited former Rep. Liz Cheney for her disruptive actions while she was on the J6 Committee and acting in unethical ways with witnesses.  eff Clark discusses legal concerns surrounding Liz Cheney’s interactions with Cassidy Hutchinson during her representation by attorney Stefan Passantino, suggesting possible legal implications for those involved. He criticizes Cheney’s approach as unethical, claiming that Cheney was involved in secret meetings to prepare Hutchinson’s testimony, which he finds ironic and hypocritical, given Cheney’s past positions. Clark emphasizes that if political dynamics shift, figures like Jack Smith may rely on "prosecutorial immunity” to defend themselves, further adding irony since Smith argued against immunity for Trump. Clark also touches on a broader issue of “weaponized” bar complaints and character assassinations, particularly aimed at Hutchinson’s former lawyer. He expresses disbelief that Passantino would coach Hutchinson to lie, suggesting that her claims against him reflect a deeper ethical problem. He criticizes the media and legal establishment for what he sees as a hypocritical double standard, particularly in relation to Cheney’s conduct. Finally, Clark argues that President Trump’s requests for key documents related to election interference are crucial to his defense but are being improperly restricted by the courts, undermining due process rights.  Jack Posobiec, on Steve Bannon’s War Room, shared his observations about Kamala Harris’s campaign struggles in Pennsylvania. He noted that Harris is failing to engage with local leaders and union members, especially in critical areas like Philadelphia. He contrasted this with Barack Obama’s successful 2008 campaign, where Obama built independent structures to gain local support. Posobiec criticized Harris’s campaign manager, Nikki Loud, as being out of touch with the ground realities. He also highlighted growing frustrations in Philadelphia over crime and drug issues, with people demanding action. Posobiec further speculated that Harris’s lack of attention to the ground game could signal potential ballot fraud operations. He raised concerns about irregularities in Michigan, citing an imbalance between registered voters and actual citizens in some cities, which he attributes to poor election practices. Posobiec’s discussion underscores a broader worry about the integrity of future elections.  Jonathan Kepperman discussed the FBI’s recent revision of crime statistics and criticized the Biden administration for downplaying rising crime. He pointed out that although the administration claimed crime had decreased by 5.8%, more comprehensive data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) showed a significant 55% rise in violent crime over the last three years. Kepperman expressed frustration, stating that “people see what’s in front of them,” and accused the government of gaslighting the public about crime, inflation, and immigration. He emphasized that “people are fed up with being lied to” and are increasingly aware of the reality, even if they don’t discuss it openly with their peers. Kepperman called for systemic changes, including “mass deportation” and a “complete overhaul at the FBI,” to address these issues. He urged listeners to follow his work at Passage Press and stay informed on the real crime statistics.  Eli Crane provided an update on Donald Trump’s strong polling lead, noting Trump is 20 points ahead in the betting markets. Crane emphasized that "everything is to play for” as the election approaches, especially in battleground states like Arizona. He expressed disappointment with a recent ruling by a Biden-appointed judge preventing measures to ensure that only legal citizens vote before the election. Crane criticized this decision, saying, "the border is wide open” and suggested that allowing illegal immigrants to vote is part of a broader strategy. He mentioned efforts to challenge election practices, referencing work with figures like Greg Phillips from “2000 Mules.” Crane urged transparency in the election process, encouraging citizens to record any suspicious activity at polling stations. He also highlighted the importance of supporting candidates like Justin Heap, who is fighting to clean up Arizona’s election system, and praised Trump’s momentum in Arizona, noting the energy at recent rallies.  Noah Formica has been actively registering voters across Pennsylvania for Donald Trump. "I have registered 2,750 voters here in the state of Pennsylvania for Donald Trump,” he reported, while traveling across the state. He emphasized the importance of vigilance regarding drop boxes, advising caution since it’s challenging to regulate who uses them. Formica supports Trump’s push for early in-person voting to ensure transparency. Trump is making multiple appearances in Pennsylvania before the voter registration deadline on the 21st, including events in Pittsburgh. Formica highlighted efforts to capitalize on these rallies and encouraged supporters to volunteer, even beyond voter registration, by knocking on doors and making phone calls. For those wanting to assist, Formica directed them to contact him via Twitter (@nformicaGOP) or through the website dpaction.com. “We’ve got to pull out all the stops,” he stressed, urging grassroots participation to maximize voter turnout for Trump.  Salleigh Grubbs, chair of Cobb County GOP in Georgia, expressed concern over recent rulings about election procedures, calling the media’s portrayal “propaganda.” She criticized a Superior Court decision requiring immediate certification of election results despite ongoing Republican efforts to combat voter fraud. “It saddens me,” she said, noting issues like ballots stuck in scanners that inflate vote counts. Grubbs defended the proposed election rules, arguing that they align with Georgia’s legislative acts and are necessary to ensure integrity. “These proposals are common sense,” she insisted, countering claims that the timing of rule changes would cause administrative chaos. She blamed the delays on “previous members of the election board who refused to do their job.” Despite the late introduction of these rules, Grubbs emphasized that the current board members are working diligently to secure fair elections in Georgia, stating that “reasonable members” are now in place to restore trust in the process.  Sophie Georges discussed how minorities fared better under the Trump administration compared to the current one, particularly in homeownership. She highlighted that “the policies during the Trump Administration were beneficial for all Americans,” noting that low inflation and low mortgage rates, around 2%, made homes more affordable. During 2017-2021, homeownership rates increased for Latinos by 4%, Asians by 3%, and Blacks by 2%. In contrast, current high inflation and mortgage rates, now over 6%, have disproportionately harmed ethnic minorities, pushing many into affordable housing categories. Georges noted that “people who were middle class have now fallen into that affordable housing qualifying category” due to rising home prices and a housing shortage. She emphasized that the issue isn’t just policy but competent management of the economy, explaining that “empowerment of people” through homeownership is key to building wealth. Current economic conditions, she added, are creating significant financial strain, especially for retirees who “are hanging by a thread.” Georges shared her research on her website, realsafyrealestate.com, to provide valuable insights on these issues. </div>
