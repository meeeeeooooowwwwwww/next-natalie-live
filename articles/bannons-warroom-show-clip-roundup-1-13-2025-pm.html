    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 1/13/2025 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Steve Bannon and Rob Bluey discussed the upcoming challenges and critical actions President Trump will face upon taking office. They highlighted the importance of Trump’s executive orders on day one, which could range from immigration reforms to addressing the national debt and trade issues. Bannon emphasized the need for a swift and efficient Senate confirmation process to ensure that Trump’s team is in place to implement these orders, especially with a looming resistance from the “deep state” in the federal bureaucracy. Bluey shared a poll showing that nearly 50% of federal employees plan to resist Trump’s directives, particularly those who voted for Kamala Harris. He stressed that, unlike Democrats in 2021, Republicans must urgently confirm Trump’s cabinet to avoid delays in his agenda. The conversation also touched on the broader issue of entrenched bureaucrats who remain in power across administrations, undermining the president’s authority. Both Bannon and Bluey agreed on the need for action and unity among Republicans to support Trump’s priorities. They concluded by mentioning Daily Signal’s focus on Congress and their efforts to cover the confirmation hearings and provide timely updates on the administration’s progress.  Josh Pettit and Steve Bannon discussed the challenges in California politics, highlighting that the state’s problems are as deep, if not deeper, than those at the federal level. Pettit emphasized that despite efforts like recalling Governor Gavin Newsom or addressing local political incompetence, the core issues in California lie within its entrenched administrative and bureaucratic structures. He pointed out that California’s most powerful lobby isn’t the tech or labor lobby but the environmental lobby, which has shaped state politics for decades. The environmental industrial complex, Pettit explained, has gained immense control, particularly through agencies like the California Department of Water Resources and the California Coastal Commission. These agencies, he argued, hinder vital infrastructure projects such as water storage capacity, which could address California’s long-standing water shortages. Despite record rainfall in recent years, Pettit stressed that money allocated for water infrastructure had been misappropriated and funneled into environmental projects that benefit lobbyists and consultants. Pettit also discussed how California’s environmental laws, especially the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), have been weaponized to block projects. This, combined with constant litigation, delays critical infrastructure projects, leading to inefficiencies like the stalled high-speed rail project. Ultimately, Pettit warned that no political change could address California’s deep-rooted issues without dismantling these bureaucratic systems. He plans to expose this in future discussions further.  David Drucker joined the discussion, highlighting the strategic thinking behind the upcoming political battles, particularly focusing on the midterm elections. He pointed out that figures like Hakeem Jeffries are preparing to raise two billion dollars to flip key seats and regain control of the House. This power shift would set the stage for another round of impeachment efforts against former President Trump, signaling a return to familiar political confrontations. Drucker noted the significant involvement of high-profile figures like Mark Zuckerberg, who contribute millions to influence the outcome. He also referenced his piece in The Dispatch, where he discussed how political players anticipate these moves and position themselves strategically for the midterms.  Natalie Winters recounted recent events involving Mark Zuckerberg.  Darren Beattie talked about his recent investigations into the actions of Norm Eisen and Jen Rubin.  Ben Freeman talked his investigations into the actions of think tanks in the United States.  Natalie Winters mocked Michael Cohen  </div>
