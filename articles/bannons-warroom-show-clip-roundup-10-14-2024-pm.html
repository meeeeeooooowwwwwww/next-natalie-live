    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 10/14/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Natalie Winters reacts to a news article that calls her out for her remarks about retribution when President Trump is re-elected, saying that certain people will face “Treason” charges.  Winters doubles down, saying Miley will also face “Treason” charges from Trump in her rant.  Davis critiqued the legal and political actions taken against Donald Trump and others associated with him, describing them as part of a broader “lawfare” strategy aimed at undermining Trump’s political career. He argues that Obama, Biden, and their teams engaged in illegal actions, such as the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, to spy on Trump and protect figures like Hillary Clinton. Davis claims Clinton’s actions, including foreign bribery through the Clinton Foundation, were hidden, and similar tactics were used in 2020 to suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story. He criticizes the indictments against Trump and his allies as politically motivated attempts to interfere with the 2024 election. Davis calls for a criminal investigation into what he views as a conspiracy against Trump, emphasizing that justice, not retribution, should be the goal. He also highlights concerns about a Colorado Supreme Court judge, Monica Marquez, who he believes is a left-wing radical, urging voters to remove her from office due to her extreme views. Part One:  Part Two:  Jim Hoft, in his commentary on The Gateway Pundit, focuses on the alleged overseas voting fraud and media backlash. He highlights that the media, particularly outlets like MSNBC, are now discussing overseas votes after his team exposed the lack of voter ID requirements for overseas ballots. Hoft criticizes the system, claiming that individuals, including non-citizens, can vote using just an email address, without proving citizenship or residency in certain states like Michigan. He argues this loophole can be exploited to sway elections in swing states, noting several lawsuits in states like North Carolina, Michigan, and Pennsylvania have emerged since his reports. Hoft also dismisses claims that exposing these issues is an attack on military voters, emphasizing that his focus is on potential fraud, not legitimate military votes. He calls on Republicans to take legal action in battleground states to address what he sees as a fraudulent system being used by Democrats to influence the 2024 election.  Benjamin Roberts, associate editor of I’m 1776, discussed the systemic issues in Springfield, Ohio, where NGOs and local churches, often backed by federal subsidies, play a significant role in facilitating the resettlement of Haitian migrants. Roberts revealed that these organizations prioritize migrant housing and employment, often to the detriment of local citizens, including newly homeless Americans. He pointed to Springfield’s mayor, whose LLC rents properties to multi-generational Haitian families, and noted a rise in crime, sexual harassment, and unlicensed driving by migrants. Local women reported being followed in public spaces, but law enforcement often ignored their complaints. Additionally, rising rent costs have displaced many residents, as landlords, sometimes in collaboration with NGOs, prioritize migrant families. Roberts criticized the federal government’s involvement and warned of the broader implications for small American towns overwhelmed by unregulated immigration.  Natalie Winters, again, talked about her dislike of the Republican party.  Caroline Wren criticized the Senate Leadership Fund (SLF), led by Mitch McConnell, for its ineffective spending in Republican Senate races. She highlighted SLF’s poor track record over the last four election cycles, pointing out that internal polling used by SLF showed questionable data. Wren questioned why, despite this polling, SLF was allocating funds disproportionately to weaker candidates, such as spending millions on Larry Hogan and Bernie Moreno while neglecting stronger contenders like Carrie Lake and Ted Cruz. Wren suggested that SLF’s decisions are politically motivated, particularly to avoid supporting candidates like Cruz and Lake, who oppose funding for the Ukraine war. She also criticized the consultant culture surrounding SLF, particularly figures like Karl Rove, whom she claims have continuously failed yet still influence campaign spending. Ultimately, Wren argued that SLF’s involvement is a "kiss of death” for candidates and that Donald Trump’s success in key states, rather than SLF’s funding decisions, will determine Republican victories in Senate races. She urged people to disregard the recent SLF polling memo and expressed confidence in candidates like Lake and McCormick, expecting them to win alongside Trump.  Brian Schimming, the Wisconsin GOP chair, shared his insights on the state’s role as a critical battleground for the 2024 election. He emphasized the intensity of the race, noting that Kamala Harris’s multiple visits to cities like Milwaukee and Green Bay signal "panic” in her campaign. "Polling shows Wisconsin and other swing states are within two points,” Schimming explained, adding that Trump is currently up by around one to two points in their internal data. Schimming highlighted how Wisconsin’s history of tight races—decided by fewer than 30,000 votes—makes every voter crucial. Trump’s frequent campaign visits, including stops in La Crosse and Wausau, are energizing grassroots efforts, Schimming said, attracting "thousands of people,” even in rural areas. Trump’s push for early voting also stood out. According to Schimming, Trump encouraged Republicans to vote early, explaining it could "save resources” and target persuadable voters. Schimming emphasized the importance of mobilizing non-voters, particularly among conservative groups. "If we can get even a percentage of these people to vote, Trump will win Wisconsin,” Schimming concluded, calling for volunteers to join the GOP’s efforts in the final weeks of the campaign.  Michele Morrow talked about a debate she is participating in tonight in Southern Pines.  Grace Chong delivered a motivational message to the WarRoor audience, focusing on voter registration and participation as the 2024 election nears. She emphasized the importance of mobilizing support in battleground states like Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Nevada. "It’s critical to register voters in these final days,” Chong urged, as voter registration deadlines approach. Chong also stressed the significance of early voting, stating, "We must vote early this year, especially in battleground states.” She explained that securing early votes would provide more time to ensure all ballots are counted and help "beat the Democrats at their own game.” Chong recommended several apps to assist with voter mobilization, including the Early Vote Action app and TP Action app. She encouraged the audience to "get out 10 to 20 people a day” and ensure they follow through by voting. She also reminded people to sign up for the WarRoom.org newsletter for updates on grassroots activism and other articles to share with friends. In closing, Chong reminded listeners of Trump’s supporters’ loyalty, stating, "In January 2020, it was the Posse that had President Trump’s back.” She rallied them for the "home stretch,” encouraging them to stay energized and help "close the deal” by getting Trump reelected.  Jenny Holland discusses the alarming influence of corporate media across Western nations, particularly the way media misrepresents events to fit a globalist agenda. She highlights an analysis by Italian journalist Enrico Francescani, who attributed UK riots not to a tragic murder but to Russian trolls and misinformation. Holland, a media professional, found this narrative shocking, noting that it wasn’t limited to American media but echoed across European outlets as well. She points to a growing “transnational media class” that shares more in common with elites abroad than with their own populations. This disconnect leads to biased reporting, especially regarding nationalist movements. Holland cites a case in Ireland where the fiancé of a murdered woman was unfairly portrayed by the media for advocating for prioritizing citizens. She believes this media distortion contributes to social unrest and public frustration across various nations. Holland continues to write about these issues on her Substack. </div>
