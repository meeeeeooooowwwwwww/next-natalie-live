    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 9/17/2024 [AM]</h1>
    <div>Natalie Winters gave her thoughts about Hillary Clinton.  Mike Davis discussed the ever-emerging immigration crisis and exposed why so many influential people prefer controlled immigration over the more orderly, rules-based immigration system in the United States.  Scott Presler passionately encouraged War Room Posse members to check their voter registration status on National Voter Registration Day, urging them to ensure they’re registered at their current address and with their preferred party, especially in closed primary states. He raised concerns about Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, where thousands of voter registration and mail-in ballot applications reportedly remain unprocessed. Presler emphasized that Luzerne is pivotal, being a Democrat stronghold potentially flipping Republican, with the voter registration deadline looming. He warned that delays in processing mail-in ballots could disenfranchise voters, especially in tight election margins, and encouraged everyone to demand accountability. Additionally, he highlighted the increase in Republican mail-in ballot requests in Pennsylvania counties and promoted voter registration among underrepresented groups like hunters and the Amish. Presler urged action, encouraging people to distribute voter registration forms, particularly in colleges and veterans’ organizations, to ensure wider voter participation.  Mike Davis discussed the importance of election officials being transparent about election issues to dispel voters’ concerns and gain the most trust from the public.  In a conversation between Mike Davis and Jeremy Kaufmann, Kaufmann shared his unsettling experience with federal agents visiting his home. He described it as “the least American experience” in his life, noting that the agents refused to identify themselves or explain their presence. Kaufmann, a self-proclaimed libertarian from New Hampshire, believes the visit was intended as political intimidation. He voiced concern that the government is targeting "right-thinking Americans” while ignoring genuine threats, such as "illegal Venezuelan gangs” in other states. Davis echoed these concerns, criticizing the federal government’s lack of resources for protecting key figures like Donald Trump. Kaufmann sees these actions as part of a broader left-wing authoritarian agenda, yet he remains hopeful about New Hampshire’s future, stating, “We still have tens of millions… who hold these Pro Liberty values.” He is determined to continue speaking out, adding, "I’m not planning to let up.”  Lee Smith, author of Disappearing the President, talked about the escalation of the media and other political pundits to set up a narrative that President Trump would have to be shot because of his dangerous narrative. </div>
