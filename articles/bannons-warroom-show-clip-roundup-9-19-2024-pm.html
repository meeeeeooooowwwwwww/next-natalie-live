    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 9/19/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Natalie Winters talks about Chip Roy coming to the WarRoom on Wednesday to discuss his reason for wanting the Save Act attached to the funding bill, which she is against.  Darren Beattie discusses what he sees as a pattern of suspicious incidents involving President Trump and bomb threats, including a recent event in Long Island. Initially reported as an explosive device near a Trump speech venue, the media quickly dismissed it as a false alarm and labeled those concerned as conspiracy theorists. Beattie highlights an unusual detail: a private citizen, unaffiliated with law enforcement, was training a bomb-detection dog at the same location. He draws parallels between this incident and historical events like 9/11 and the Oklahoma City bombing, where training exercises coincided with real-world crises. Beattie suggests the possibility of government involvement or cover-ups, criticizing the media for ignoring deeper questions, such as the identity of the private citizen involved and the implications of this peculiar timing. He questions the media’s focus on discrediting figures like Elon Musk rather than investigating these bizarre circumstances further.  Kristan Hawkins discusses the tragic death of Amber, a woman who sought a chemical abortion for her twins in North Carolina but died of sepsis after receiving abortion drugs. Amber missed her surgical appointment and was sent home unsupervised after taking the medication. She fell severely ill, eventually reaching an ER, where despite treatment for infection, a hysterectomy was delayed for 20 hours, and she ultimately died. Hawkins compares this case to another in New Mexico, where Aisha Atkins also died of sepsis following a chemical abortion, but with little media attention, as it occurred in a pro-abortion state. Hawkins criticizes the Biden-Harris administration’s FDA, blaming them for Amber’s death due to their removal of safety protocols for chemical abortions in December 2021. She argues that the administration prioritized expanding abortion access over ensuring the safety of mothers, abandoning safeguards like ultrasounds and follow-up visits that could prevent such tragedies. Hawkins emphasizes the political motivations behind these changes, suggesting they disregarded women’s health. Part One:  Part Two:  Todd Bensman reported to the WarRoom after attending a committee meeting at the US Capitol earlier in the day.  Bensman talked the dangerous situations we can expect in the future because at least 400 terrorists have come over the Southern border.  Joe Allen, sitting in for Steve Bannon, highlights concerns about artificial intelligence (AI) and its societal impact. He discusses the growing influence of AI, noting how it has infiltrated daily life like “soulless insects.” Allen criticizes the shift towards reliance on non-human entities, especially in schools and religious settings, where AI is used to guide learning and even spiritual practices. He warns that this “cultural revolution” will increasingly replace human interaction with machines, with AI becoming a dominant companion for many. Allen also points to the surveillance potential of AI, referencing Larry Ellison of Oracle and his vision of AI being used for behavior modification by constantly monitoring individuals. He connects this to broader concerns about privacy erosion, especially post-Patriot Act, where surveillance has stifled political dissent and made privacy seem obsolete. Allen warns that AI’s pervasive surveillance could eventually lead to imprisonment for mere speech, amplifying concerns over personal freedom and autonomy.  Noor Bin Ladin discusses the increasing global push for censorship, particularly against free speech, under the guise of combating misinformation and disinformation. She highlights speeches from figures like Ursula von der Leyen and Hillary Clinton, noting that they call for collaboration between governments, corporations, and institutions to suppress dissent. Ladin argues that these actions are eroding civil liberties, as seen in cases of individuals facing legal consequences for online posts in the U.S., U.K., and Switzerland. She criticizes how these powerful entities determine what constitutes misinformation while being major purveyors of it themselves. Ladin warns that the growing digital surveillance and censorship are leading to a “digital dystopia,” where individuals risk imprisonment for merely expressing dissenting views. She emphasizes the urgency of resisting this control before freedoms are completely lost, pointing out that without free speech, people cannot challenge these oppressive systems.  In the discussion, Tim Hinchcliffe critiques the U.N.’s Global Digital Compact, expressing concern about its underlying motives. While the compact uses appealing language, Hinchcliffe views it as a tool for expanding digital control, censorship, and surveillance under the guise of fostering inclusion and safety. The initiative, set to be debated by the U.N., aims to restructure digital frameworks and address the digital divide, but also introduces broader surveillance measures and tighter data governance. Hinchcliffe highlights that this push aligns with transhumanist goals, where governments and corporations collaborate to enforce control. He questions the potential tensions between globalist and nationalist objectives, as some U.N. member states are defiant towards overarching global governance. Ultimately, the compact is seen as advancing digital authoritarianism, which could further entrench governmental and corporate powers over individuals while limiting dissenting perspectives. </div>
