    <h1>Natalie Winters Exposes Fauci's Daughter Working With State Health Dep. Promoting COVID-19 Vaccines</h1>
    <div>Executive Editor Natalie Winters talks to hist Steve Bannon about the latest news on the origins of Covid-19, including Dr. Andrew Huff’s new book “The Truth About Wuhan.” Perhaps most interesting is her discussion (after the 11:50 mark) about Anthony Fauci’s daughter working for Twitter during the time when Twitter was censoring discussions about Covid. The daughter left Twitter earlier this year, but is now working for an NGO to advise state governments on Covid policy.  </div>
