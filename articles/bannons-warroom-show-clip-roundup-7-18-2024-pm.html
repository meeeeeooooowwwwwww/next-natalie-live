    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 7/18/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>During a WarRoom discussion, Natalie Winters, Monica Crowley, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene addressed several key issues.  The conversation turned somber with a tribute to the late Lou Dobbs, whom Crowley remembered fondly for his pioneering work on immigration issues and his impact on media. Crowley highlighted Dobbs’ foresight on border security and illegal immigration, noting his clashes with CNN executives over these topics. She reflected on his significant role in shaping national discourse and expressed deep sympathy for his family. Rep. Greene then discussed President Trump’s upcoming speech, predicting it would address immigration and aim to unite Americans. She criticized the Biden administration’s handling of immigration and expressed concern over reports of resistance from Secretary Mayorkas and the FBI regarding ongoing investigations. Greene emphasized the need for transparency and accountability from federal agencies.  At the premiere of the film Government Gnageters at the RNC, Raheem Kassam, Kash Patel, and MA Taylor discussed the film “Government Gangsters,” which pays tribute to Stephen K. Bannon and honors the late Lou Dobbs. Kassam opened the Q&A by highlighting the film’s challenges, noting the dangers in making such a politically charged documentary. He acknowledged the bravery required to tackle topics that could put a target on the filmmakers’ heads, referencing recent events and the ongoing fight against corruption. Patel responded by acknowledging the numerous death threats they’ve received, expressing that these threats are a sad reality but won’t deter them. He emphasized the importance of standing firm and drawing strength from leaders like Bannon and Trump, stressing the need to take actions that positively impact America. MA Taylor echoed Patel’s sentiments and dedicated the film to Lou Dobbs, recognizing Dobbs’ significant contributions to the news and media. Taylor emphasized that Dobbs’ legacy in truth-telling is generational and will be remembered for a long time. Despite the overwhelming challenges posed by entities like the FBI, Taylor reinforced the film’s mission to expose and combat corruption.
