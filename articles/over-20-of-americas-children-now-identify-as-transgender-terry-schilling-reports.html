    <h1>Over 20% Of America's Children Now Identify As Transgender, Terry Schilling Reports</h1>
    <div>Terry Schilling of the American Principles Project talks to “War Room” co-host Natalie Winters about the gender confusion being seen in younger generations. “A new survey from Rasmussen shows that double the amount of Gen Z’ers, almost 20 percent of them, identify as transgender or non-binary… That’s double what millennials identify as, so that brings up the question, “Are we creating this?” and the obvious answer is yes. This is an ideology that is being pushed on our kids in schools. It’s being used to bully kids into this trans ideology, but the good news is …  there’s been an explosion of legislation to address this transgender threat to our kids and our families.”  </div>
