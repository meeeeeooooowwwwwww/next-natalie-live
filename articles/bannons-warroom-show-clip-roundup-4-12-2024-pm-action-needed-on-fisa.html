    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 4/12/2024 [PM] Action Needed on FISA</h1>
    <div>Natalie Winters hosted the evening edition of WarRoom, and Steve Bannon hosted WarRoom Battleground. Natalie’s guests discussed FISA, a rally for President Trump in NYC on Monday.  Steve’s guests talked about transhumanism and a Judeo-Christian event. Highlights: US Rep Anna Pauline Luna talked about her procedural move on FISA with a Call to Action Gavin Wax talked about an upcoming rally for President Trump in NYC on Monday Mike Benz talked about the FISA debate Joe Allen of WarRoom talked about transhumanism Dr. Shawn Rowland Jase medical talked about the medical supply Rabbi Pesach talked about a Judeo-Christian event in Dallas Call to Action: Keep calling your Rep. about the FISA bill, see Rep. Anna Paulina Luna segment for more details Reccomended Reading: Drug shortages reach all-time high Full show in segments: A bill to extend FISA was passed in the House but hit a snag due to a procedural motion from Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican from Florida. This motion will require another vote to advance the bill to the Senate before a looming deadline. The bill involves reauthorization, likely related to surveillance and intelligence matters, and there seems to be contention over including a warrant amendment. Some Republicans, dubbed as “Traitors,” voted against the amendment, aligning with Democrats. Representative Luna is depicted as a staunch defender of civil liberties and constitutional rights. She pushes for the inclusion of the warrant amendment to protect against warrantless surveillance and urges constituents to contact their representatives to influence their votes on the matter. Additionally, Representative Luna has introduced legislation to increase penalties for child sex offenders, advocating for harsh sentences, including the death penalty or life imprisonment. She emphasizes the importance of such measures in protecting children and deterring offenders.   The discussion with Mike Benz revolves around the contentious issue of FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) and its implications for civil liberties, national security, and political power dynamics. There’s frustration over what’s perceived as a lack of action on the southern border and a focus on the FISA debacle instead. The conversation touches on how FISA can be weaponized against political opponents, particularly within the Republican Party, and how it intersects with broader issues of censorship, misinformation, and domestic surveillance. Benz expresses concerns about the erosion of constitutional rights, particularly regarding warrantless surveillance and the targeting of American citizens. There’s a sense of urgency in addressing these issues, especially in light of the upcoming 2024 election, where FISA and related issues could significantly shape the political narrative. The conversation reflects a deep-seated distrust of government institutions and a belief that civil liberties are threatened by unchecked government power.  The conversation with Gavin Wax highlights concerns about the erosion of constitutional freedoms, particularly regarding the recent FISA controversy. There’s criticism of Republican Party leadership for what’s perceived as a disconnect from the base and the country’s foundational principles. The focus then shifts to an upcoming rally organized by the New York Republican Club to protest what they see as a politically motivated prosecution of President Trump by the Manhattan District Attorney. The rally aims to demonstrate support for Trump and opposition to what they view as unjust treatment. Participants are encouraged to join the rally with signs, flags, and enthusiasm to make their voices heard. Investigative reporter Barbara Warren’s involvement is also mentioned, suggesting a coordinated effort to mobilize support for the rally.  Grassfed Beff from wwwMeriwetherFarms.com  The discussion revolves around a panel event in Dallas, Texas, featuring Laura Loomer, Frank Gaffney, and Lieutenant Colonel Allen West. The event aims to discuss Israel’s fight for Western civilization and the two-state delusion. The conversation highlights the importance of understanding the true nature of the conflict in Israel and how it is not just about Israel, but a battle against Judeo-Christian Western civilization. The panelists will also address Israel’s challenges, such as the Biden administration’s policies and the internal political landscape. The event will take place at the hexa Event Center in Richardson, Texas, on April 14. Doors will open at 4 p.m. Central Time. The panel discussion will start at 5 p.m., followed by a Q&A session. For those who cannot attend in person, the event will be live-streamed on Real America’s Voice starting at 6 p.m. Eastern Time. Throughout the conversation, Rabbi Pesach expressed his concerns about the two-state solution and the lack of consensus within the Jewish community in Israel and the United States. He emphasize the importance of understanding the true intentions of Palestinian leadership and the need for the Jewish community to support Israel’s efforts to defend itself against terrorism and radical ideologies.

Bill White discussed events in Fulton County, Georgia, following a successful fundraising event for President Trump. Despite the positive outcome of the event, WHite said,  the next day, Chris Carr, a prosecuting attorney appointed by Governor Brian Kemp, announced an investigation into Lieutenant Governor Bert Jones for alleged election interference. While believes this investigation is politically motivated and implicates Kemp and his associates, suggesting they are complicit in prosecuting Trump. White indicates a conflict of interest involving Ronnie Willis, who has been disqualified from prosecuting Jones due to her ties to his opponent and he questions the timing and motivations behind the investigation, alleging that Kemp opposes Trump and seeks to remove potential political rivals like Jones from the picture.  The conversation revolves around the increasing number of drug shortages in the United States, which has reached a new high of 323 medications. The root causes discussed include the dependency on foreign countries like China for active pharmaceutical ingredients and generic medications, supply chain disruptions, and the increased demand for specific drugs due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on mental health. Dr. Shawn Rowland suggests securing the supply chain and bringing production back to the United States is crucial in addressing this issue. However, they also express concern that the problem will continue to worsen as the necessary actions to resolve it are not being taken. In response to the issue, the speaker suggests that individuals can take action by using platforms like “Jase medical” to stay informed and potentially find alternative solutions to avoid being affected by drug shortages.  Mike Lindell is giving free shipping to the WarRoom with promo code: WarRoom  Joe Allen discusses the transformative potential of artificial intelligence and the singularity, emphasizing the unprecedented ability for individuals to imagine and create with the assistance of AI. The conversation delves into AI’s dark underside and the concerns raised by experts like Eric Schmidt and Marc Andreessen. Joe Allen, author of Dark AEon, provides insights into the underlying premises of transhumanism and posthumanism, warning about the potential consequences of AI surpassing human intelligence.  Bannon discusses the assault on traditional culture and civilization, drawing parallels between the destruction of traditional values by the Chinese Communist Party in China and the ongoing fight against global tyranny in the Western world. He emphasizes the importance of cultural preservation and resistance against oppressive forces like the World Economic Forum, the Chinese Communist Party, the KGB, the mullahs in Persia, and the deep state in the United States. The discussion touches on the tragic situation in Ukraine, where amputees are returning to the front lines due to a lack of support from the state.Ben Harnwell highlights the manipulation of mainstream media to shape public perception and underscores the need for vigilance against the erosion of rights and freedoms, as exemplified by the recent tie vote on warrants in the United States. Harnwell calls for action against political figures who prioritize their own interests over the well-being of their constituents.  This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, "Action, Action, Action,” as Steve Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) “I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said , adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: “This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the “Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. “I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn Posse.. go do some action and be a part of your own nation’s history.</div>
