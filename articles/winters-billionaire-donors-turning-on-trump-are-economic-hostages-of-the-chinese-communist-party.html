    <h1>Winters: Billionaire Donors Turning On Trump Are 'Economic Hostages' Of The Chinese Communist Party</h1>
    <div>Executive Editor Natalie Winters talks to host Steve Bannon about the importance of the billionaires who are turning on President Trump. Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, who recently announced he would not support Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, told Bloomberg News that China “is a center of focus for our investment team." “The globalist billionaire donor class … really are financial oxygen of the Chinese Communist Party, and that’s the future that they want to condemn America to as well. That’s why they’re not backing Trump.”  </div>
