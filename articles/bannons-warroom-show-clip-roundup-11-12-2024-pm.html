    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 11/12/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Natalie Winters talked about an Atlanta article that now condones the idea of a Deep State cling. It protects important career bureaucrats.  Natalie Winters exposes Attorney General Merrick Garland, who was found in contempt of Congress but not required to be punished for his hypocrisy toward Steve Bannon and demanding he be imprisoned.  Phillip Patrick outlined the problems with Bidenonmcs and the issues President Trump faces in his new administration.  Mike Benz talks about the censorship tactics he believes will be used to target supporters of President Trump.  Natalie Winters uses humor to address the very large number of supposed Democratic voters who Supported Joe Biden in the 2020 election but did not vote in the 2024 election.  Steve Bannon reacted with satisfaction to a video of Democratic strategist James Carville expressing anger at the Democratic Party’s losses, saying Carville’s frustrations highlighted the party’s failure to address issues like public safety and an "identity disaster.” Bannon emphasized that Carville’s comments reveal the Democrats’ weakening power, contrasting it with what he sees as a "total and complete” control held by the MAGA movement and Republicans in government. Bannon called for Republicans to protect their power by blocking Democratic judicial appointments, preparing for transitions in government leadership, and gearing up to confront the "Deep State” in the executive branch. He credited grassroots efforts for this success, including precinct strategies and volunteer work that helped turn the tide, particularly when official Republican resources were low. Bannon encouraged his audience to learn from Carville’s frustrations, playfully suggesting he might replay the clip, alongside other MSNBC coverage, to emphasize the Democrats’ "crushing defeat.” He concluded by pointing out that the Republican movement, though often underestimated, has now emerged as the dominant force.  Steve Stern and Steve Bannon discussed their grassroots strategy to empower the America First movement through local and state election integrity efforts. Stern highlighted the success of volunteer-based efforts to protect and mobilize the vote, particularly in precinct-level organization and early voting initiatives. He credited Bannon’s leadership in rallying support and ensuring transparency across multiple states. They emphasized the importance of vigilance in election security, especially with upcoming challenges. Stern invited listeners to join a special election integrity call featuring prominent speakers like Jovan Pulitzer, General Michael Flynn, and others who will address issues from ballot monitoring to border security.

In this exchange between Steve Bannon and Ben Harnwell, they discuss the shifting political landscape in Europe and the growing influence of populist-nationalist movements. Bannon critiques the European political class, especially the elites in Brussels and NATO, who once thought President Trump and populism were finished, but now, with the rise of support for such movements, they are eager to reconnect. Both Bannon and Harnwell reflect on how their phones are now flooded with messages from people who had previously distanced themselves. Harnwell highlights the changing attitudes towards Trump, noting that even the UK is considering granting him a second state visit, showing the shift in global dynamics. They also touch on European issues, such as the Netherlands’ efforts to tackle migration and Italy’s increasing support for American-style populism, with people there looking to leaders like Trump for guidance. Bannon emphasizes the importance of delivering for the people, whether in or out of power, and stresses that the so-called “retribution” against corrupt elites is not about Trump but about representing the will of the American people. They conclude with a discussion on the ongoing fight against the political establishment, underscoring the rise of populism as a force for change. </div>
