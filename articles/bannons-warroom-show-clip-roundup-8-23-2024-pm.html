    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 8/23/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Natalie Winters talked about her feelings about the Democrat National Convention.  Darren Beattie commented on the Democratic National Convention, noting its lack of substantive content but acknowledging its effectiveness in appealing to average, low-information voters. He argued that the convention “struck all the right notes” with a tone that appeared inviting and well-received by the public. Beattie highlighted that speeches, particularly those by Obama and Kamala Harris, were designed to resonate positively with viewers, focusing on emotional appeal rather than policy depth. Beattie also pointed out the strategic advantage Democrats gained from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s departure from the race and his implied support for Trump. This shift forces anti-woke centrists, who previously saw Kennedy as a viable alternative, to reconsider their position. According to Beattie, this scenario complicates the Democrats’ efforts, creating “a whole other headache” by expanding the battleground to multiple fronts, which could diminish the impact of any short-term boost from the convention.  Josh Hammer talked about his reaction to the Democrat National Convention.  Natalie Winters gave some of her thoughts and ideas about the important activism that is being done by the WarRoom audience for the coming elections, building up to November and beyond.  Natalie Winters analyzed the Democrats’ election strategy for November and how she thinks they will get Democrats elected.  Nataline Winters talked about her analysis of the Democrat’s playbook and predicted that they would accuse Republicans of stealing the election. </div>
