MTG talked about the frustration of the federal government, saying it ran out of money and could only provide hurricane victims with $750.00 after spending billions of foreign governments and illegal aliens.  Darren Beattie discussed the latest revelations about Jan. 6th, 2021, and the latest information on what footage the FBI had of the events.

Clark also talked about other violations by Smith against Trump just days before people go to vote.  EJ Antoni talked about the need to focus on the labor participating rate in the jobs numbers in order to best understand the economy and what kinds of jobs are being created and where, warning that the growth may be in the government sector.  Joe Allen discussed technology development, which he feels is advancing too quickly without ethical considerations, and he reacted to John Kerry’s rant about free speech.  John Hinchliffe reacted to John Kerry’s speech about the First Amendment, indicating that he believed the introduction of many media sources impacted the loss of control for older generations like John Kerry, who have exploited environmentalism.

Harker pointed to the Biden administration’s funding of Ukraine and illegal aliens.  Grace Chong talked more about the WarRoom intuitive to sending out texts and making phone calls, and she also reminded people to make sure they are registered to vote.   Chong challenged the WarRoom audience to write personalized letters and postcards especially.  Chong referred to three apps for doing this work.  </div>
