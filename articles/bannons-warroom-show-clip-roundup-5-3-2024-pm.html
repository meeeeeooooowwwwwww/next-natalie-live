Full show in segments: EJ Antoni talked about foreign workers replacing American workers and the motivation for corporations, politicians, and others to celebrate an illegal invasion of the nation with foreigners when others are not happy- and what that means for economics and national spending.  Tulsi Gabbard talked to Steve Bannon about her background and her beliefs.  She has a new book out, which Bannon praised, where she outlined her commitment to the values of the America First movement.  Gabbard talked about her military service and her rejection of the Democrat Party platform.  Paul Ingrassia talked to Natalie Winters about his live reporting from the New York City trial, in which President Trump faced a harsh trial.  Ingrassia reported that there were not any Republicans who had come to the courthouse to show their support for President Trump.  Declan Hurley talked about what he has witnessed as a journalist on the campus of the University of Chicago as the Sharia Supremacy movement came to his area and ran their flag up the flagpole.  Hurley, who writes for a student media site, had a lot to say about the school’s reaction to students attempting to fly the American flag.  Dr. Naomi Wolf gave her reaction to the campus chaos around the nation and gave her perspective as a former Democrat about how groups are organized and paid to protest in situations like this for political theater.  Mike Lindell spoke with Natalie Winters about the day’s deals for the WarRoom.  Catherine O’Neil spoke with Natalie Winters about the special deals for the WarRoom on her beef products.  Eric Prince talked to Steve Bannon about his view that spending on defense contracting is overwhelming the national debt and causing a problem. Prince relied on his background to discuss the details of the expenditure, which does not actually help with military readiness and is, in his opinion, largely wasteful spending for the taxpayer.  Ben Harnwell reacted to the Tulsi Gabbard interview. He talked about his support of her and why he believed that is it smart for America First movement to adopt her into the fold for the preservation of the movement. Harnwell gave thought-provoking examples of his support.  “In our movement, the Citizen comes first” -Steve Bannon This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, "Action, Action, Action,” as  Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) “I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said, adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: “This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the “Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. “I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn Posse.. go do some action and be a part of your own nation’s history. </div>
