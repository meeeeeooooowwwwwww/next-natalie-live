    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 11/19/2024 [AM]</h1>
    <div>Steve Bannon, in a discussion with Mike Davis, criticized Senate Republicans for failing to counter Democrats’ push to confirm federal judges during the lame-duck session. He highlighted Elizabeth Warren’s leadership in advancing 28 pending judicial nominations and warned of the long-term impact these lifetime appointments could have on reshaping federal courts. Bannon and Davis emphasized the crucial role of appellate courts, where 99% of federal cases are decided, and noted that Biden’s judicial appointments could surpass Trump’s historic achievements. They argued that Senate Republicans must emulate Democrats’ obstruction tactics from Trump’s presidency by showing up to work, voting, and halting these confirmations. Bannon framed the judicial battle as essential to preserving the Trump Revolution and protecting constitutionalist principles, calling on Republicans to prioritize their responsibilities and take immediate action.  In this discussion with Steve Bannon, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (MTG) expressed concerns over the escalating Ukraine-Russia conflict, emphasizing that Congress has not formally declared war on Russia, yet U.S. involvement continues to intensify. She questioned what actions the House of Representatives could take to prevent further escalation, suggesting invoking the War Powers Act to ensure the President consults Congress. MTG also highlighted the lack of public support for war and criticized the Biden administration’s handling of the conflict. MTG then shifted to another topic, criticizing the inclusion of a transgender member of Congress, Tim McBride, and the potential threat this poses to women’s privacy. She expressed concerns over men using women’s bathrooms and locker rooms, framing it as an assault on women’s rights. MTG demanded action from Speaker Johnson to protect women’s spaces, noting that the issue must be addressed in Congress’s rules. She concluded by rallying support for President Trump’s future administration, emphasizing the importance of unified resistance to the opposition, including Senators who voted for controversial appointments. MTG called for a focus on American sovereignty, the economy, and ending the military-industrial complex’s influence over Congress. She urged continued grassroots action to challenge the establishment and support America First policies. Part One:   Part Two:  Part Three:  In this conversation, Steve Bannon and Garrett Ziegler discuss several key political issues. Ziegler starts by thanking Bannon for his support during Bannon’s time in prison and mentions his efforts to provide election night coverage. The pair criticize the left-wing media for undermining their reporting. Ziegler asserts that their focus on figures like Hunter Biden and the Biden family’s alleged corruption is crucial for the America First movement. They discuss the possibility of Joe Biden issuing pardons for his family, notably Hunter Biden, given his legal troubles. Ziegler suggests that Biden should issue blanket pardons, noting the legal jeopardy Hunter faces. Bannon agrees, emphasizing the dangerous conditions Hunter could face in federal prison, and calls for the justice system to hold all political figures accountable, particularly those involved in corruption. The conversation shifts to the need for stronger leadership in U.S. government agencies, with Ziegler advocating for the firing of corrupt officials in the DOJ and other institutions. They also critique the progressive overreach in agencies like the FCC and DOJ, calling for a return to a more accountable and constitutionally grounded system. Both express their concerns over the misuse of lawfare and the need for a stronger, more unified approach to restoring justice and accountability.   Natalie Winters details the Democrats’ plans to resist President Trump’s America First agenda.  </div>
