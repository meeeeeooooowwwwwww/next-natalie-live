    <h1>Steve Bannon’s Defiance and Legal Battles is a Fight for the MAGA Movement</h1>
    <div>Steve Bannon, a top former aide to President Donald J. Trump and the host of the top-rated Podcast (also seen on Real America’s Voice), “Bannon’s WarRoom“-after a Thursday court appearance- spoke to the media and affirmed his firm belief in his legal team and their preparedness to escalate his case over a contempt of Congress charge to the Supreme Court if needed. Co-host of the WarRoom, Natalie Winters, set the scene on a Thursday Broadcast: Outside the courthouse, Bannon sharply criticized the Justice Department, accusing officials like Merrick Garland and Lisa Monaco of attempting to silence the MAGA movement and Conservative grassroots conservatives. “They’re not going to shut up Trump, they’re not going to shut up Navarro, they’re not going to shut up Bannon, and they’re certainly not going to shut up MAGA,” Bannon asserted. In the latest developments, a federal judge revoked Bannon’s bail and ordered him to report to prison by July 1 for his contempt of Congress conviction. Bannon was sentenced to four months in jail and fined $6,500 for defying a subpoena during the January 6 Capitol attack investigation. Despite a D.C. Circuit Court panel unanimously rejecting his appeal, Bannon’s lawyer argued that imprisonment was unjust. However, the judge determined that there was no substantial legal question to justify Bannon’s continued freedom. Bannon’s defiance remained evident as he highlighted the growing strength of the MAGA movement, confidently stating that if an election were held today, “President Trump would win in a landslide.” He emphasized their resolve to prevail in court and the upcoming elections. “We are going to win this; we’re going to win this at the Supreme Court,” he declared, projecting a significant victory for Trump and MAGA. Bannon’s comments further his support for the America First agenda and the MAGA movement’s momentum and resilience against historic lawfare in the political arena. Bannon stressed his team’s dedication to combating what appears to be highly unjust actions by the Justice Department. “All of this is about one thing,” Bannon said, “This is about shutting down the MAGA movement, shutting down grassroots conservatives, shutting down President Trump.” With a resolute message of confidence and defiance, Bannon concluded, “There’s nothing that can shut me up and nothing that will shut me up. There’s not a prison built that can keep me in. All victory to MAGA.”  Watch: BANNON: All of this is about one thing—shutting down the MAGA movement, grassroots conservatives and Pres Trump. Not only are we winning, we are going to prevail. There’s not a prison or jail built that can shut me up. pic.twitter.com/rjTvjHlrzW — Grace Chong  (@gc22gc) June 6, 2024 LINK Watch the WarRoom program daily from 10-12 EST on Real America’s Voice M and 5:00-6:00 PM RAV  6:00-7:00 PM EST on Frank Speech M-F for updates.  </div>
