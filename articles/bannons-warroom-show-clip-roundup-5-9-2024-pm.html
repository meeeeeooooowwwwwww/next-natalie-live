    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 5/9/2024 [AM]</h1>
    <div>The cold open was Joe Biden, looking and sounding very feeble and weak, talking about the economy, juxtaposed with commentary about Trump’s economy and foreshadowing by Hillary on MSNBC talking about Trump. MTG’s motion to vacate footage, with the Uni-party booing. “We should call the bluffs of people right now and find out now. This is the great unmasking. If your congressman wasn’t on the list of the 11, you should call them,” Bannon said. Highlights: Steve Bannon talked about the process in DC that does not address the needs of the American people. Steve Stern talked about the Precinct Project. Eli Crane spoke about why he supported MTG’s motion to vacate. Adam Molan talked about his new article covering Peter Navarro. Brody Mullins talked about his new book. US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene talked about her motion to vacate on Thursday. Full show in segments: Natalie Winters and Steve Bannon open the program with cold open footage that shows Democrat Joe Biden speaking about President Trump and the economy in a very low-energy voice, making bold statements.  Democrat Hillary Clinton is seen in the footage compilation as well, which causes Steve Bannon to rip apart and expose decades of corruption by both Hillary and Bill Clinton that happened during all of their years in public service.  Steve Stern heads up the discussion about the powerful Precinct Project, giving details of the next group call for all interested parties who would like encouragement and instruction on how to get into their local parties and get control away from RINOS.  Stern talked about his upcoming birthday celebration and some of the newest campaigns the group is working on, including getting writers in every state to start newsletters to inform the public of the action they are taking.  US Rep. Eli Crane talked about his motivations for supporting US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on her motion to vacate the Speaker’s chair on Wednesday, and he spoke about the importance of what Greene was doing regarding saving the Republic. Crane told Bannon that his constituents in AZ supported him and the stand he took and that the disconnect was between the people and the Reps who voted with the Uniparty.  US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene talked to Steve Bannon about her motion to vacate, reconfirming that she felt it was the right thing to do to expose the power in DC and how the other reps who make up the uni party are not listening to the concerns of the people.  She disagreed with others who said her actions were dangerous to the Republican majority.  Brody Mullins talked about his new book, the Wolves of K Street, and gave Steve Bannon a preview of the secret history of how big money took over the big government and formed an almost unbeatable alliance.  The little guys are not represented at all anymore, which is the feeling of the average American, and the people with money, as described, seem to get all the breaks.  Natalie Dominguez from Home Title Lock talked to Steve Bannon about the very scary reality of a woman who lost her home after the title was stolen.  A woman went through legal battles to rescue and salvage what was left of her property after a thief stole her home.  Adam Molon makes his case to Steve Bannon about why he wants President Trump to choose Peter Navarro for his running mate for the 2024 Presidential elections.  Molon wrote a piece for Epoch Times outlining his point of view and discussed with Bannon.   "In our movement, the Citizen comes first” -Steve Bannon This newsletter is to implement the work of WarRoom guests. Remember, “Action, Action, Action,” as  Bannon reminds us.  (Credit for the Pencil drawing: Chris Hiers) "I drew for Rush Limbaugh for 20 years, his monthly Limbaugh Letter covers and illustrated his Rush Revere books as well. After he died, I was gutted tbh and decided to return to drawing basics. I have evolved into an old-school pencil portrait artist, and I have 2 books are in the works now, and I feel in a pretty good groove again ,” Hiers said, adding this about the Bannon piece specifically: "This particular work [Bannon as John Paul Jones] was rooted in a show of support for the "Honey Badger” SKB after he was leaving the courtroom last Sept and he quoted John Paul Jones. "I have not yet…” I thought it would make an interesting piece.” Now it’s your turn Posse.. go do some action and be a part of your own nation’s history.  </div>
