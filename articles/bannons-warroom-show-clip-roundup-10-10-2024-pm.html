    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 10/10/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Natalie Winters responded to the Vanity Fair article about Steve Bannon and the WarRoom, criticizing people who are continuing to support Ukraine as a priority for American spending.  Darren Beattie discussed the investigations of the Pipe bombs from Jan. 6th, 2021, and a new report that he has been following and reporting on—showing Federal informant involvement on that date. He questioned the timing of holding the report back until after the November election.  Mike Benz talked about the CIA and the DOD and their operations and talked about his suspicion over a case with a person who had been detained for terrorism being delayed.  Natalie Winters referred to the Vanity Fair article about Steve Bannon.  In this conversation between Ben Harnwell and Brandon Showalter of The Christian Post, they discussed recent data from the CDC, which showed 3.3% of high school students identify as transgender, with an additional 2.2% questioning their gender. Showalter argued that this is not a natural phenomenon, but the result of “ideological indoctrination” within schools. He claimed that the concept of being “born in the wrong body” is an “anthropological falsehood” and part of a broader agenda. Showalter emphasized the dangers of medical treatments for gender dysphoria, likening gender-affirming care to “atrocious medical scandals” such as lobotomies. He criticized the inconsistency of allowing gender transition procedures for minors while prohibiting tattoos. Showalter also noted how some European countries are scaling back on such treatments, contrasting them with the U.S. and Canada, which are continuing these practices.  He concluded by promoting his documentary series, Generation Indoctrination, which explores the transgender debate and its impact on families In their conversation, Ben Harnwell and Mark Mitchell discussed the state of polling and media narratives surrounding the 2024 presidential race. Mitchell expressed satisfaction that Rasmussen’s predictions, particularly about Donald Trump leading Joe Biden, have been accurate, saying, "I should be taking a victory lap.” He noted that the polls have consistently shown Trump ahead, and media claims of sudden shifts are misleading, with the polling staying “locked in steady.” Mitchell emphasized that Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, has consistently struggled, saying, “She overwhelmingly lost” when compared to a “fresh start” candidate. He also pointed out the media’s efforts to paint her as a strong contender, despite her own admission of being an underdog. Referring to Trump’s dominance, Mitchell remarked, "She needs an act of God to win.” They also touched on betting markets, where Mitchell explained that Trump’s chances have dramatically increased, with movements in key battleground states such as Michigan and Wisconsin, now leaning towards Trump. He concluded that, despite some denial in the media, the numbers clearly indicate that “Trump is winning this thing,” and that even poll aggregators like Nate Silver may soon reflect this reality.   Ben Harnwell and Col. John Mills, Mills discusses concerns over foreign influence on U.S. elections, the effectiveness of intelligence agencies, and the integrity of election laws. Mills shares details about a meeting with intelligence agencies, including the FBI and Homeland Security, where officials briefed about foreign involvement in U.S. elections. Mills was critical, saying, “For $80 billion a year, we’re not necessarily getting our top people.” He questioned why U.S. Code 611, which requires U.S. citizenship to vote, was omitted from discussions on election laws: “It’s not debatable. You have to be a U.S. citizen to vote.” Mills also raised concerns about a deep-state agenda, suggesting that intelligence agencies might use election interference as a pretext to expand domestic spying. He said, “They want to go after populists… they want to manipulate the vote.” Mills also pointed out discrepancies, such as the omission of assassination attempts by Iranian operatives, linking Iran’s actions to China’s influence: “Iran would not exist today if it wasn’t for China.” The conversation highlights skepticism about the intelligence community’s handling of election security and foreign interference.  Ben Harnwell and Sigal Chattah discussed the urgency of ballot harvesting efforts in Nevada ahead of the 2024 election, following its decriminalization in 2020. Chattah emphasized the need for action, saying, “We are officially going to start changing gears to ballot harvesting operations,” and highlighted the involvement of groups like America First, Turning Point USA, and others. She encouraged voters to speak to neighbors and ensure they vote, noting that economic challenges, such as a 22% inflation rate and high gas prices, can only be addressed by supporting Donald Trump. Chattah also stressed the importance of voting down ballot to maintain the Republican majority in Nevada’s legislature. She warned, “If Republicans do not maintain the Senate this legislative cycle, we will see a state income tax passed.” She urged people to sign up at the Nevada GOP website and join the ballot-harvesting efforts. Chattah mentioned Trump’s upcoming events in Reno and encouraged participation while reminding listeners of her observance of Yom Kippur.  Grace Chong’s comments highlight the significant influence of Steve Bannon’s War Room show and its dedicated audience, which she calls the “Army of the Awakened.” Chong enthusiastically shares that a recent Vanity Fair article acknowledges the War Room’s impact, especially noting how Bannon has turned the show into a platform for educating everyday Americans on the global power structure. She emphasizes that Bannon’s reference to his audience as “peasants” is a badge of honor, symbolizing their crucial role in challenging the elite and corrupt systems. According to Chong, Bannon views the movement’s strength as lying in the ordinary Americans, who together can make a difference. Chong encourages the War Room Posse to read the article and keep the momentum going, especially as early voting begins across crucial battleground states. She stresses the importance of ensuring voter registration before deadlines in states like North Carolina, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Nevada. Additionally, Chong highlights the need for early ballot chasing to counter the Democrats’ extended efforts in the previous election cycle. She motivates the audience to stay involved, urging them to spread the word and continue their activism, which she says is visibly shaking the system.   Chong also thanks everyone who has sent JoJo encouraging notes to uplift her spirits. JoJo has also shared these notes with the WarRoom team for encouragement, reporting that the team likes to talk about the supportive messages they are getting. </div>
