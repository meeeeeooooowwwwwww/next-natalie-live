    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 10/17/2024 [AM]</h1>
    <div>Natalie Winters updated the audience on actions by the Biden-Harris administration’s lack of action at the Southern Border and discussed that 1/3 of cameras were being reported at the border as “inoperable.”  Liz Harrington reported that problems were found in Fulton Co. Georgia as early voting got underway in the State.  Harrington noted that the court is spending a high dollar amount to avoid having an independent monitor of elections there.   Mike Davis discussed Jack Smith’s latest attempts at election interference, which were aimed at stopping President Trump’s victory in November with lawfare tactics. He called for Trump to use his powers to clean out the corruption at the Judiciary level after being sworn into office in January 2025.  Mike Benz explains some of his investigations into the actions of the Administrative State’s attempts to stop President Trump should he win in November.  Harmeet Dhillion encourages everyone to vote as early as possible and continue their vigilance and activism past election day.  Natalie Winters reacts to a news story that shows supporters of President Trump and opponents of Kamala Harris are being censored by algorithms on Meta, the platform formerly known as Facebook. </div>
