    <h1>Natalie Winters: DHS Leak On Censoring Dissenting Speech Involved Debanking Plan</h1>
    <div>“War Room” executive editor Natalie Winters talks to host Steve Bannon about what we are learning about how the Department of Homeland Security has been working with Big Tech and Big Money to shut down free speech that threatens the ruling regime. “What’s really interesting is that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which was leading the joint effort between the FBI and the DHS in terms of censoring misinformation and disinformation, whatever they would define that as, in all of these meetings … there were representatives not just from the federal government and Twitter, but also JP Morgan Chase… which is the largest financial institution in the United States… This really speaks to the powers in society and how they are weaponizing banking.”  </div>
