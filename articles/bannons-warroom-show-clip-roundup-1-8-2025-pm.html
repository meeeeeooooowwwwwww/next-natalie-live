Part One:  Part Two:  Mike Cernovich talked to Natalie Winters about the details of the fires in California and what he knew about people who lived in the area as well as the political problems in the state that may have increased the likelihood of the tragic fires.  Cernovich told Winters he felt that President Trump should consider a federal takeover the state.  In this discussion on Steve Bannon’s War Room, Mike Davis highlighted the contentious North Carolina Supreme Court race, where Democrat Allison Riggs claimed victory by 734 votes. Davis argued that 60,000 ballots cast without required voter identification—driver’s license numbers or Social Security digits—were illegitimate. He criticized Democratic operatives for attempting to certify these votes and praised the North Carolina Supreme Court for pausing certification to address the legality of these ballots. Davis implied that such issues point to broader concerns about voter integrity and potentially unlawful practices. Bannon and Davis linked this controversy to broader themes, such as the importance of judicial elections and the role of external organizations like Davis’s Article III Project. Davis urged War Room listeners to support President Trump’s agenda actively, particularly in securing qualified cabinet picks. He stressed the significance of grassroots mobilization and the War Room audience’s influence on political outcomes. Bannon echoed Davis’s sentiments, commending his past efforts in judicial confirmations and advocacy for election integrity. Together, they underscored the importance of vigilant action in safeguarding democracy and ensuring fair governance.  In their conversation, Jason Jones, currently in Turkey, discusses his mission with Steve Bannon on WarRoom. Jones explains that he is meeting with persecuted Christian and minority communities across the Middle East through his Vulnerable People Project, which has advocated for these groups since 2003. He highlights the ongoing genocide and decimation of ancient Christian communities in Iraq, Syria, Gaza, and Lebanon, urging Middle Eastern leaders to protect these vulnerable populations. Jones acknowledges Turkey’s strategic significance, despite its political complexities. He emphasizes Turkish President Erdoğan’s aspirations to re-establish the Ottoman Empire and its caliphate roots, underpinned by a resurgence of the Muslim Brotherhood. Bannon agrees, describing Turkey as a serious geopolitical force with a vision of regaining dominance over Islamic holy sites. Jones notes that the Middle East’s diversity is often misunderstood in the West and stresses the need for partnerships to preserve its ethnic and religious communities. He praises Bannon’s influence and thanks him for the platform to advocate for Christian minorities. The conversation also briefly touches on Jones’s article critiquing Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy’s positions on international issues.  John Mills joined Steve Bannon on WarRoom to discuss the geopolitical tensions in South Korea and the region’s significance as a major U.S. ally. With 28,000 U.S. troops stationed there and critical military installations, Mills emphasizes the United States’ unwavering support for South Korea. Mills outlines escalating domestic and regional challenges. He highlights a power struggle in South Korea, where the Democratic Party is allegedly using unconstitutional tactics to consolidate power, including actions involving the National Election Commission. President Yoon Suk-yeol’s recent declaration of martial law, purportedly to address corruption, underscores the gravity of the situation. On the international front, North Korea’s recent mobilization of artillery from underground shelters into firing positions signals heightened tensions. Mills warns that the Chinese Communist Party might exploit the unrest to assert influence in the region. Bannon and Mills commend South Korea’s resilience and strong Christian heritage, emphasizing the need for vigilance and solidarity. Mills provides updates on social media platforms, promising ongoing coverage of the unfolding situation.
