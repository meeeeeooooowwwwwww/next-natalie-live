    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 28 Jan 25 [AM]</h1>
    <div>Steve Bannon emphasized that Trump campaigned to hold his enemies accountable, and his supporters backed that vision. He criticized DOJ staff tied to January 6th cases, claiming they’re being targeted for removal despite civil service protections. Bannon highlighted Trump’s aggressive actions to overhaul agencies like the FDIC, which ensures bank deposits, framing it as part of the MAGA agenda. Bannon criticized mainstream media like CNN, calling them irrelevant, and slammed officials like Greg Abbott for performative leadership on border issues. He called for mass deportations, stating all 12-15 million illegal immigrants must leave to restore the community and protect resources for working-class Americans. He insisted this effort should be firm but empathetic, emphasizing no debate. Bannon praised Trump’s idea to send repeat criminals to foreign prisons, believing it would reduce crime. He also supported Trump’s broader moves, from deploying troops to revamping agencies, and lauded figures like Kristi Noem for bold actions. Bannon urged MAGA supporters to stay focused on the larger mission of systemic reform, criticizing overselling of immediate victories and calling for a long-term commitment to the movement’s goals. His tone remained defiant, framing MAGA as unstoppable and essential for saving America.  Steve Bannon interviewed Raheem Kassam about the culture of MAGA and his new restaurant venture in Washington, DC.  Steve Bannon dives deep into the relationship between Obama, Biden, Wall Street, and Big Tech. He calls Obama and Biden “reactionary” presidents, masking their actions as “progressive” through performative optics. Bannon claims Obama made a deal with Silicon Valley at a San Francisco airport, empowering platforms like Facebook to crush the Clintons and establish monopolistic power. This marked a shift from capitalism to a system of monopolies and rent-seeking, dominated by tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Bannon highlights how Wall Street and Silicon Valley created an oligarchy, abandoning ordinary Americans. He points to the 2008 financial bailout as a moment when elites saved themselves while leaving the little guy to suffer. This fueled a populist backlash that led to Trump’s 2016 victory. Big Tech, according to Bannon, now suppresses dissent, ensuring their platforms push progressive agendas while silencing voices like Breitbart. He argues that the age of the algorithm, dominated by Silicon Valley, has stifled true innovation. Meanwhile, China’s TikTok and AI advancements have outpaced the U.S., leaving the country vulnerable. Bannon’s core message: the elites sold out the American people, creating monopolies and abandoning traditional values for their gain.  Steve Bannon talked to Natalie Winters from the White House.  Steve Bannon and Frank Gaffney discussed the growing challenges in the Middle East. They focused on the actions of Turkey, Iran, and Qatar. Bannon warned about Turkey’s push to revive the Ottoman Empire under Erdogan, calling him aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood. He urged the U.S. to label the group a terrorist organization. Bannon stressed the importance of addressing radical Islamic supremacism. But he cautioned against rushing into unnecessary wars. He believes the U.S. needs a clear strategy that avoids looking weak or reckless. Gaffney praised Bannon’s efforts to expose these threats. He mentioned Trump’s 2016 agenda to fight “radical Islamic terrorism” through strength and decisive action. Gaffney introduced resources like VictoryCo.org and GateStone Institute to help educate the public on these issues. Both agreed that the U.S. must stay focused on its interests. They emphasized balancing restraint with strength. For them, the key is understanding the region’s players and their ambitions. </div>
