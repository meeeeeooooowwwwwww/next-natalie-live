    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 11/15/2024 [AM]</h1>
    <div>Steve Bannon talked about the Populist movement as a foundation for the victory behind President Trump’s 2024 victory and also about where he saw the resistance to the Populist movement shaping up with the nation’s intellectual elites, who he has called the “Credential Class”.  Natalie Winters talked to Todd Bensman about the nomination for  “Border Czar” Tom Homan who is expected to be very assertive on the mass deportation process promised by President Trump.  Charlie Kirk discussed the percentage of people who lost when they opposed President Trump’s nomination and gave an update on his bottom-chasing campaigns, which were pivotal in the 2024 election.  General Flynn discussed the historic lawfare used against him. Bannon asked Flynn if he would consider working with Tulsi Gabbard at the DNI, and Flynn agreed that he would—possibly as Gabbard’s Deputy.  Phillip Patrick talked about the importance of precious metals and applauded President Trump for his victory.  Jack Posobec talked about the situation at the US Border. He spoke of the activity of the Mexican and foreign drug cartels that are operating in plain sight around the nation as a result of the open borders.  Steve Bannon and Dr. Gina discussed the necessary steps to win the media narrative and push President Trump’s nominees over the finish line.  Natalie Winters discussed the Soros family’s meeting in Washington, D.C., and speculated on the topics of their discussions. </div>
