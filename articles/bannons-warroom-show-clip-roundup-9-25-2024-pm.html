    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 9/25/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Alex Jones expressed admiration for the passion and faith of populists, describing their shared love for God, freedom, and America as “radical” in today’s society. He pointed out that for 30 years, he has consistently opposed wars, standing for peace with information against globalists like Soros and Obama. Discussing recent legal battles, Jones highlighted that InfoWars is facing liquidation while media consolidation favors figures like Soros. Despite these challenges, he vowed to continue broadcasting, provided he is not imprisoned or killed. Jones connected InfoWars’ persecution to a broader globalist agenda aiming to dismantle America. He predicted that Trump’s potential electoral victory will be undermined by fraud and even assassination attempts. He concluded by stressing that the upcoming election is “the most important in modern history,” with threats against Trump symbolizing deep state desperation.  Natalie Winters continued her harsh critique of Speaker Johnson.  Jeff Clark discussed his research on legal cases, particularly focusing on a specific individual’s litigation history. He shared that he used the Westlaw legal research database, which he finds more comprehensive than others, to search for cases where this person was involved. Clark said he examined both federal and state cases, “not even confining it just to California,” and used advanced search logic to identify relevant cases. His findings showed that “she did not argue any cases,” and he couldn’t locate trial transcripts either, which he found suspicious. Clark expressed skepticism, saying, “I’ve never heard of a court in the United States that would not allow you to duplicate a transcript of a public trial.” He hinted at uncovering more information soon, promising “more research” to be released shortly.  Dr. Bradley Thayer testified before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, discussing the multifaceted Cold War with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which he described as an ideological and geopolitical struggle. He emphasized that communism, a “Western ideology imported into China,” is central to the CCP’s aggression and has caused immense destruction, erasing China’s cultural pillars and killing millions. Thayer argued that understanding the CCP’s communist ideology is critical for Congress and federal agencies to grasp its inherently aggressive nature. He also highlighted that the CCP was a product of “Soviet imperialism,” with its origins deeply rooted in Soviet influence, from which Maoism and Xi Jinping’s modern ideology evolved. Thayer declared the CCP illegitimate for three reasons: its foundation in Soviet imperialism, its continuation of failed communist ideology, and its corrupt leadership under Xi Jinping, which only rules for itself. He concluded that the U.S. is in a “new Cold War” with China, calling it the great struggle of the 21st century, one that will determine whether the world remains free or succumbs to totalitarianism led by the CCP.  Dr. Braley Thayer highlights the significant threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in a comprehensive analysis. He emphasizes that their ideology, rooted in communism, makes them “hyper-aggressive,” viewing the U.S. as the primary obstacle to their global dominance. Thayer notes the CCP’s proficiency in “political warfare,” a strategy that allows them to achieve political objectives without direct military conflict, particularly aiming to undermine the U.S. from within. He credits Deng Xiaoping as a master of this strategy, enabling China to rise economically by integrating into global systems and exploiting U.S. investment, trade, and manufacturing. Thayer warns that current Chinese leader Xi Jinping is “extremely dangerous,” comparing his ambition to surpass even Mao Zedong. He describes China as a “bad driver” operating a “Soviet knockoff” car with flawed, aggressive communist ideology. This combination, along with volatile international conditions, creates a precarious situation. Thayer calls for ending economic engagement with China, asserting that U.S. trade and investment are saving the CCP during their current economic struggles. He concludes by urging global efforts to support the Chinese people in overthrowing the illegitimate regime, comparing the CCP’s rule to apartheid South Africa.  In a discussion involving Captain James Fanell, Sam Faddis, and Dr. Braley Thayer, the focus was on Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Waltz and his extensive connections to China, having visited the People’s Republic of China over 30 times since 1989. Sam Faddis questioned the legitimacy of Waltz’s business ties and his continuous access to China, noting that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) would not allow such engagement without approval. "This whole business with Waltz just stinks,” Faddis remarked, expressing disbelief in the narrative that Waltz was advocating for democracy during his time in China. Faddis highlighted the potential dangers posed by Waltz’s involvement with China, particularly the risk of Chinese intelligence (MSS) targeting American students who accompanied Waltz on his trips. He questioned whether Waltz was naive or complicit in exposing these students to Chinese influence, suggesting that "clearly, he’s chosen a side, and it’s not ours.” Captain Fennell added to the conversation by discussing the CCP’s aggressive military actions, including a recent intercontinental ballistic missile test. He emphasized that the CCP’s expansion of its nuclear arsenal presents a significant threat to U.S. national security. The panel agreed that the U.S. has failed to effectively counter CCP influence, allowing political warfare, propaganda, and infiltration to compromise American elites. Faddis warned, "The war is already started, and they’re winning because we’re not fighting back,” stressing the need for a drastic shift in U.S. strategy to disengage from China and prioritize domestic interests.  </div>
