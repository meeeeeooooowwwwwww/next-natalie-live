    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 11/26/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters had a fun and pleasant conversation about her points of view on numerous news headlines and topics, and Winters gave her reaction to trending news. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Steve Bannon and Frank Gaffney discuss U.S. foreign policy, focusing on Israel’s conflict with Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran, alongside broader global tensions. They criticize the Biden administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, alleging it undermines Israel’s security by empowering hostile forces like Hezbollah and Iran. Gaffney claims Biden’s policies contradict the pro-Israel sentiment of American voters and impede Netanyahu’s efforts to neutralize threats. They accuse the administration of using extortion tactics, such as weapon supply delays and leveraging U.N. resolutions, to coerce Israel into unfavorable agreements. The discussion links these actions to a broader agenda of weakening U.S. allies and prioritizing adversarial regimes. Gaffney draws parallels to Obama-era strategies, suggesting an overarching continuity in policies allegedly hostile to Israel. He promotes initiatives like the "Working Group on Israel” to counter these trends. Turning to Ukraine, Bannon and Gaffney express concerns over escalating tensions, including potential tactical nuclear deployment. They frame this as part of a Chinese strategy to entangle U.S. resources globally, hindering its ability to counter China in the Indo-Pacific. They argue for restraint, suggesting Trump could negotiate peace and realign U.S. priorities. Their conversation underscores skepticism about current U.S. leadership and advocates for a robust response to global challenges.  Steve Bannon and Robbie Starbuck discussed Starbuck’s efforts to challenge wokeness in corporate America, describing it as a battle against a “new form of communism” that seeks to control the minds of corporate leaders rather than seizing production. Starbuck outlined his strategy of targeting companies reliant on conservative consumers, forcing them to abandon woke policies by demonstrating financial consequences. Notable successes include Harley-Davidson, John Deere, and Tractor Supply, which faced significant losses due to consumer boycotts. Starbuck highlighted Walmart as a turning point, negotiating a shift away from woke policies. He emphasized that consumer-driven backlash reshaped the corporate landscape, as companies began recognizing their dependence on regular Americans rather than ESG-driven entities like BlackRock or Vanguard. Bannon noted how woke ideologies infiltrated corporations through mechanisms like CEI scores and international advocacy groups pushing "a new type of capitalism.” Starbuck explained that such frameworks replaced traditional profit-driven leadership with ideologically aligned executives. Looking ahead, Starbuck urged the next Trump administration to prioritize dismantling woke frameworks through DOJ investigations and executive orders, particularly by addressing civil rights violations linked to DEI programs. He also suggested aligning federal contracts to discourage woke policies. Both agreed that this grassroots movement was reshaping corporate America, with Bannon calling it an economic battle to restore traditional values and economic fairness.  Jacqueline Toboroff talks about her thoughts and opinions about President Trump’s choice for Surgeon General.  Natalie Winters shares her thoughts and feelings about President Trump’s Surgeon General pick. </div>
