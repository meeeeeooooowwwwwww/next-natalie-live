    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 9/30/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Mike Howell expressed frustration with Congress’s inaction, emphasizing the need for more aggressive enforcement of subpoenas. He criticized the tendency to issue subpoenas without follow-through, stating that “a subpoena is worthless unless you actually enforce it.” Howell urged Congress to pursue federal court action to obtain crucial information, like databases of non-detained illegal aliens, including those with criminal records such as “rapists and pedophiles and murderers.” He proposed comparing this list with voter rolls to ensure the election is decided by legitimate voters. Howell lamented Congress’s reluctance to act decisively, saying, “They’re not going to court, they’re not fighting these things,” and urged lawmakers to “see this one through.” He dismissed media attention on the issue as inconsequential, noting that it’s not a topic of interest for mainstream outlets like Vanity Fair or The New York Times but rather “low level stuff” covered by smaller outlets like The Hill.  Natalie Winters talked about battleground states.  Phillip Patrick criticized Kamala Harris’s economic policies as a continuation of Bidenomics, which he views as ineffective. Harris’s proposed tax increases on capital gains, dividends, and even unrealized gains, along with her plans for increased spending, resemble an effort to “buy votes” through short-term relief at the expense of long-term stability. In contrast, Patrick praised Trump’s economic strategy, highlighting its focus on fostering a business-friendly environment by reducing corporate taxes and not increasing individual or capital gains taxes. He acknowledged the controversial tariffs Trump proposes, particularly a 20% tariff on all imports and 60% on Chinese goods, which would cause higher prices initially but lead to long-term economic gains by boosting American manufacturing. Patrick also criticized Harris’s housing proposals, arguing that injecting more money into the economy would worsen inflation. He concluded that Trump’s willingness to make tough decisions makes him the stronger candidate for economic reform.  Jeff Clark highlighted a 2008 case involving an illegal immigrant who brutally raped a woman on a San Francisco party bus while Kamala Harris was district attorney. Despite Harris’s reputation as a tough-on-crime prosecutor, the offender received a lenient three-year sentence. Clark expressed outrage, emphasizing the severity of the crime and Harris’s failure to deliver justice. He criticized Harris for presenting herself as a defender against sex crimes while letting an illegal alien with a criminal record off lightly. Clark argued that this case shatters the myth of Harris’s prosecutorial toughness, especially when contrasted with her current stance on border security. He urged people to spread this story widely, claiming it reveals inconsistencies in Harris’s record. Clark also mentioned the eventual civil lawsuit, which awarded the victim a multimillion-dollar settlement, further spotlighting the failures of Harris’s case handling.  In the discussion between Ben Harnwell and Mark Paoletta, they criticize proposed Democratic efforts to reform the U.S. Supreme Court. Paoletta argues that the bill in question aims to undermine the court’s independence by expanding its size, imposing audits on justices, and enforcing new recusal rules. He compares these efforts to Hugo Chavez’s manipulation of Venezuela’s judiciary, suggesting that Democrats seek control over the court because they oppose recent rulings on issues like affirmative action and presidential immunity. Paoletta emphasizes that Congress, with its low approval rating, should focus on its own issues rather than trying to reshape the judiciary. He also highlights what he perceives as hypocrisy, where ethical concerns are selectively applied to conservative justices like Clarence Thomas while ignoring similar conflicts involving liberal justices. Ultimately, Paoletta sees these efforts as a broader assault on the Supreme Court’s integrity and constitutional role.  In a conversation between Ben Harnwell and Kristi Hamrick, they discussed the disproportionate impact of abortion on the Black community, referencing Planned Parenthood’s founder Margaret Sanger, who advocated for controlling populations she deemed undesirable. Hamrick emphasized the national tragedy of abortion, particularly highlighting the high number of Black lives lost: “More Black children are aborted than born in New York City.” They also discussed the dangers of chemical abortion pills, which Hamrick described as having a higher risk of complications and death than surgical abortions: “They have four times the rate of accidents, 10 times the death rate of surgical abortion.” She criticized the lack of safety protocols, such as requiring ultrasounds to prevent complications from ectopic pregnancies. Hamrick further noted that the pro-life movement is the civil rights movement of today, drawing parallels to historical struggles for human rights. She warned Republicans not to back down, urging them to “stand strong” in defending life against what she called the “radical” Democratic stance supporting abortion up to birth. She concluded by promoting pro-life advocacy resources, including Students for Life and information on chemical abortion risks.  In their discussion, Linda Szynkowicz and Ben Harnwell highlighted significant irregularities with postal ballots in Florida, calling it the “Florida debacle.” Szynkowicz mentioned that half a million undeliverable ballots were wrongly counted in the primary, raising concerns about election integrity. She pointed out discrepancies in Miami-Dade and Pinellas Counties, where initial claims of 219,000 absentee ballot requests were later reduced to 20. Szynkowicz also expressed alarm over overseas ballots, noting the DNC’s push for 9 million U.S. citizens abroad to vote, despite only 2.4 million being eligible and no verification of voter IDs.  In their conversation, Ben Harnwell and Richard Stern discussed the economic consequences of President Biden’s proposal to offer $25,000 to first-time homebuyers. Stern warned that while it may seem beneficial on the surface, such government handouts inevitably lead to inflation. “There’s no such thing as a free lunch,” Stern said, pointing out that increasing government spending devalues the dollar, reducing the purchasing power of everyone else. Stern also noted that the funds required for these policies are taken from other sectors of the economy, leading to job losses and decreased investment elsewhere. He described the situation as a “Sophie’s choice,” where the government redistributes wealth through inflation without actually producing anything. Additionally, they touched on the increasing national debt and the rising costs of interest repayments, which Stern emphasized as a looming crisis. He highlighted that the U.S. is now spending more on interest payments than on defense, warning that the country faces either a debt spiral or hyperinflation. Stern expressed skepticism over the government’s ability to build 4.2 million homes efficiently, cautioning that such efforts often lead to scarcity in construction materials and further inflation. </div>
