    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 8/28/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Darren Beattie discusses the intricate dynamics of geopolitics and censorship, highlighting a recent Revolver News piece exploring these complexities. He critiques the Atlantic Council’s DFR Lab as a censorship tool for the U.S. security establishment, accusing it of weaponizing disinformation to justify censorship. Beattie notes its funding from U.S. and British governments and a Ukrainian oligarch, linking its activities to the U.S. government’s interests, especially in relation to Ukraine. He suggests that Telegram is targeted by the Atlantic Council due to its role in disseminating uncensored information from conflict zones like Ukraine. Beattie also touches on a broader shift among tech elites, with figures like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg aligning with MAGA, driven by both conviction and a need to protect business interests in a polarized environment. He argues that neutrality in the current geopolitical climate is increasingly difficult, as exemplified by Telegram’s Durov.  Mike Howell criticizes the handling of investigations by special counsels, particularly focusing on the disparity between the treatment of Donald Trump and Joe and Hunter Biden. He argues that the investigation into Trump, led by Jack Smith, has been excessive and politically motivated, with expenditures significantly higher than those for the Biden investigations. Howell contends that Trump’s case is straightforward, as he had the authority to declassify documents, unlike the Bidens, whose actions with classified materials span decades and involve corrupt interests. He criticizes special counsel Robert Hur’s investigation into Joe Biden as inadequate, merely cataloging the locations of documents rather than probing potential misuse for personal gain. Howell sees this as an example of election interference and a biased judicial process. Additionally, he highlights efforts by the left to manipulate the electoral process, contrasting them with the right’s reaction to Biden’s campaign strategies and the Democratic National Committee’s (DNC) handling of nominations.  Natalie Winters talked about her general dislike of Republicans and her anger toward them as a group. She questioned why they waited for Subpoena Judge Merchan’s daughter to investigate her financial ties to charges and cases brought against President Trump.  Phillip Patrick critiques a proposed economic policy involving price controls and tax credits, arguing that these measures will have negative long-term effects. He points out that the administration’s proposed tax credits—$6,000 for newborns and $3,600 for existing children—are not feasible because the federal government lacks the funds to support them. Implementing these policies could devalue the dollar and increase inflation. Patrick suggests that, although such measures might be worth debating if the government had the necessary resources, they are currently unrealistic and would likely exacerbate economic problems rather than resolve them.   Dr. Allen Mendenhall discusses the economic principle of supply and demand, particularly in the context of natural disasters in Alabama, such as hurricanes and tornadoes. He explains that higher prices during shortages signal suppliers to increase production or reallocate resources, helping to alleviate the shortage. Mendenhall emphasizes that increasing prices prevents resources from being depleted by ensuring they are allocated to those who need them most rather than those who value them less. He argues this mechanism is crucial, especially when essential services like ambulances need fuel. Mendenhall warns against setting price controls, stating that they can be counterproductive by disincentivizing new market entrants and innovations, ultimately keeping prices high. He critiques Kamala Harris’s economic platform for including price controls, suggesting that such policies misunderstand basic financial principles and can adversely affect supply and demand.  In a discussion between Dr. Bradley Thayer and U.S. Representative Tim Burchett (R-TN), concerns were raised about Democratic Vice Presidential pick Tim Waltz’s extensive connections to China. Burchett criticized Waltz’s frequent travels to China, citing over 30 visits since 1989 and suggesting potential undue influence from the Chinese Communist Party. He emphasized the need for transparency, stating, “Anyone who’s gone to China 30 times…wouldn’t be coming back if he at least didn’t get the approval of the Chinese Communist Party.” Burchett also voiced worries about the media’s lack of scrutiny on Waltz and potential threats to U.S. security, hinting at a broader conspiracy involving U.S. institutions. He stressed the importance of public vigilance, civility and action to prevent the perceived erosion of American values and sovereignty.  Dr. Derrek Harvey, Dr. Bradley Thayer, and Retired Captain James Farnell examined strategic developments in the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific. Harvey highlighted Iran’s continued aggression against Israel, facilitated by proxies like Hezbollah, aiming to wear down Israel’s economy and isolate it internationally. He criticized the U.S. administration for its perceived lack of support for Israel and leniency towards Iran, which he argues emboldens Iran’s efforts. Farnell then shifted the focus to the Indo-Pacific, noting the absence of a U.S. aircraft carrier in the region for the first time in over two decades, as China aggressively challenges U.S. allies, including the Philippines and Japan. He expressed concern over the U.S. response, describing it as a signal of diminishing American commitment in the region, which could encourage further Chinese assertiveness. Both experts emphasized the need for stronger U.S. actions to uphold its commitments and deter adversaries in these critical regions. Part One:  Part Two: </div>
