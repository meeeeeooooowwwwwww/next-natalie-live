    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 11/27/2024 [AM]</h1>
    <div>Bannon highlights Trump’s use of tariffs as a powerful tool against key trading partners—Mexico, Canada, and China—demanding action on issues like fentanyl and border security. He recalls Mexico’s swift response to Trump’s tariff threats, deploying troops to address migration concerns. Tariffs, according to Bannon, expose the inefficiencies of globalist institutions and align with American workers’ interests by pressuring governments to reform. He criticizes Wall Street-backed media for defending a failing system that suppresses wages for low-skilled American workers by promoting mass immigration and global competition. This strategy, he argues, prioritizes corporate profits over citizens’ welfare, driving down wages while elites reap benefits. Bannon claims tariffs would reverse these trends, increasing wages and strengthening American sovereignty. Concluding, Bannon asserts that the populist movement holds the moral high ground, focusing on economic policies benefiting American workers. He calls for bold tariff measures, believing they could dismantle the Chinese Communist Party and realign global trade in favor of U.S. interests.  Steve Bannon outlined a three-pronged strategy for reshaping government and advancing populist-nationalist policies. First, he emphasized “deconstruction of the administrative state,” targeting the entrenched bureaucratic systems that overreach into citizens’ lives. Bannon praised Russ Vought for his detailed plans to reduce federal spending and dismantle inefficient programs systematically, not just through deregulation or firing bad actors. Second, he stressed economic nationalism, including tariffs and trade policies to strengthen domestic industries. Bannon commended figures like Kevin Hassett for shifting toward populist economics and underscored the importance of a unified strategy under Trump’s leadership. Finally, Bannon addressed national security concerns, warning against escalating tensions in Ukraine, including reports of potential deployment of tactical nuclear weapons. He called for a focused effort to manage these priorities through Project 2025, emphasizing preparation with expert teams to ensure swift and effective action if Trump takes office in 2025.  In a this conversation between Kari Lake and Steve Bannon, they discussed the urgency of addressing illegal immigration under President Biden’s administration, focusing on the “Biden invasion” that began on January 20, 2021, and its impact on the U.S. border. Bannon argued for a focused approach, proposing that deportation efforts should target individuals who arrived after Biden took office, estimating this number at around 10 million. He emphasized the importance of defining this effort clearly and humanely, acknowledging that many immigrants were lured by economic interests and the Biden administration’s lax policies. Lake agreed, asserting that this deportation should be prioritized and humane, while stressing the need to send individuals back to their home countries, particularly those trafficked or involved in criminal activities. She suggested using a combination of tariffs and foreign aid to pressure countries to take back their citizens, especially as the U.S. faces global security threats, including from China. Bannon and Lake also discussed the role of foreign aid and U.S. policy, with Bannon criticizing the current administration’s approach to foreign aid, which he believes exacerbates issues like climate change and poverty. They called for a shift in foreign aid to focus on combating communism and fostering economic stability in other countries, rather than promoting progressive ideologies. Both agreed that President Trump’s economic strategies, including tariffs and negotiations, could help address the illegal immigration crisis and restore order to the U.S. border. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Natalie Winters sheds light on the ongoing efforts by the”Deep State” to undermine President Donald Trump. Winters argues that there is a concerted effort to pre-label Trump as an autocrat to delegitimize his political influence and agenda. This tactic, she asserts, is part of a larger strategy by establishment elites and bureaucratic insiders to control the narrative and prevent the populist-nationalist movement, which Trump has championed, from gaining further momentum. According to Winters, this effort is not just about targeting Trump personally, but about framing any challenge to the status quo as inherently dangerous to democracy. By labeling Trump as an autocrat, critics aim to stoke fear and paint his policies as authoritarian, even when they are rooted in American values like national sovereignty and individual freedom. This framing is seen as a way to delegitimize the concerns of millions of Americans who support Trump’s platform. Winters points to the media’s role in amplifying this narrative, as well as the ongoing legal challenges Trump faces, which she argues are politically motivated attempts to weaken his influence. She believes that by preemptively labeling Trump as a threat to democratic norms, the Deep State is trying to sideline the populist movement and prevent meaningful change in Washington. Winters argues that this effort to label Trump an autocrat is not just a personal attack on the former president, but part of a broader battle over control of American politics and governance.  Steve Bannon outlines a powerful critique of the American political system, framing it as deeply flawed and working against the interests of the American people, especially the working and middle classes. He argues that the “system defenders” cling to outdated institutions that need reform, purging, and renewal, echoing the concept of “creative destruction” that has historically driven societal progress. Bannon emphasizes the necessity of addressing the “unitary theory of the executive,” asserting that the president’s executive authority, especially in national security and law enforcement, should not be undermined by the deep state or administrative bureaucracy. He passionately defends his legal battles over executive privilege, stating that he would willingly serve time again to uphold these principles. Bannon criticizes the judiciary and Department of Justice (DOJ) for corruption, calling for a total overhaul, including firing U.S. attorneys and reshaping the DOJ with a more aggressive approach. He warns that unless populist forces seize key institutions, meaningful reform is impossible. He challenges figures like Mitch McConnell, who he believes protect the institutional status quo, and underscores the urgent need for reforming the administrative state to ensure it serves the American people rather than the elites. Ultimately, Bannon calls for a strategic fight to seize control of the institutions to effect real change. </div>
