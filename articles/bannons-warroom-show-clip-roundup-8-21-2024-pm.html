    <div>Scott Pressler emphasized the growing struggles for Democrats, pointing out that as voters hear more from Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, their polling worsens. He highlighted that Trump is gaining ground in Pennsylvania, where his organization, Early Vote Action, is heavily focused. “The data is reflecting that the honeymoon is over,” Pressler noted, indicating that even with Democrats sidelining Biden and Harris bringing in Tim Walz, Republicans are still out-registering Democrats across Pennsylvania’s 67 counties. Pressler stressed the importance of economic issues in the upcoming election, stating that voters are increasingly motivated by concerns over the economy, peace, and immigration. He mentioned hearing from voters who have never voted before but are now registering because “life was easier and more affordable four years ago.” He criticized Harris for being ineffective, asking why she hasn’t implemented her proposals during her time in office, and emphasized the need for Republicans to continue highlighting her failures. Pressler also encouraged voters to ensure their voter registration is accurate and to engage with local election boards to prevent any election day issues. He concluded by urging support for his efforts, emphasizing the importance of grassroots action in securing a victory for Trump.  Natalie Winters highlights scenes from the Democratic National Convention, where crowds act radical outside and inside the official gathering.  Mike Benz’s commentary presents a concerning view of the recent developments in Georgia’s election board, framing it within a broader context of potential governmental manipulation and historical parallels. He highlights the involvement of international and domestic intelligence agencies, including DHS and NATO, suggesting that these entities may have played roles in orchestrating events that undermine democratic processes. Benz draws connections between the recent NATO summit and historical instances of false flag operations, particularly a 1962 proposal by U.S. military officials to stage attacks on American soil as a pretext for war with Cuba. He argues that similar tactics might be in play today, with government agencies possibly manipulating events to influence political outcomes. Benz also raises the issue of how specific individuals, like Thomas Crooks, could be manipulated by intelligence agencies to carry out violent acts, which are then used to justify broader government actions. He links these concerns to the handling of the 2020 election and the role of BLM protests, suggesting that these were part of a coordinated effort involving intelligence networks. The commentary paints a picture of a deeply entrenched system where domestic and international intelligence operations intersect, potentially threatening the integrity of democratic processes. Benz warns that these patterns, if left unchecked, could further erode public trust in government institutions.  Allum Bokhari discusses the growing divide within Silicon Valley regarding free speech and censorship. He highlights how some figures, like Elon Musk and David Sacks, have taken a strong stance against censorship, especially in opposition to the U.S. Deep State’s influence on tech companies. However, Bokhari points out that major players like Google and Microsoft remain deeply entrenched in the censorship regime. He notes that these companies have not shifted their policies since the 2020 election and continue to support the censorship complex, as evidenced by their involvement in initiatives like psychological inoculation and media blacklisting through entities like NewsGuard. Bokhari argues that while some parts of Silicon Valley are resisting censorship, the industry as a whole remains divided, with significant portions still aligned with establishment interests.  Mike Lindell meets Harry Sisson at the DNC, and they troll each other. Hilarity ensues.  Mike Lindell joins Rudy Giuliani and Dr. Maria Ryan at the DNC to discuss the state of politics, including what happened at the DNC. Lindell jumps in and out from another location to talk about his appearance at the Democratic convention without his noteworthy mustache. </div>
