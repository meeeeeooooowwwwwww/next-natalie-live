    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 9/7/2024 [SATURDAY]</h1>
    <div>Liz Harrington focused on the backlash against members of Georgia’s State Election Board, particularly women, who are under threat for promoting transparency and accountability in Georgia’s elections. These board members passed rules to reconcile vote counts to ensure the number of votes matches the number of voters, sparking opposition. Critics, including some from Fulton County and figures like Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, are pushing back, fearing the implications of the board’s efforts to address issues like duplicate ballots. The speaker highlights the hypocrisy of media outlets like MSNBC for not defending these women despite their efforts to ensure election integrity. The commentary also references broader narratives about election integrity concerns and critiques of establishment figures.  Jenny Beth Martin provided insight into Georgia’s election integrity efforts, focusing on the ongoing fight to ensure transparent and accountable elections. She expressed approval of Governor Kemp’s decision not to remove members of the state election board, noting it as consistent with his prior actions. Martin emphasized that the board’s new rules, which reconcile vote counts and ensure ballots match voter turnout, are legal and essential for building trust in election outcomes. She also acknowledged potential legal challenges from Democrats but remained confident the rules would hold up in court. Martin encouraged grassroots action, highlighting opportunities like poll watching, phone banking, and door knocking through her organization, urging supporters not to be discouraged but to stay engaged. Lastly, she called on Governor Kemp to continue supporting election board members in their work to secure Georgia’s elections.  Todd Bensman discussed the Biden administration’s new strategy of granting refugee status to economic migrants from Latin America, which allows them to be flown into the U.S. at taxpayer expense. “We don’t normally give refugee status to Venezuelans, Cubans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans,” Bensman explained, highlighting the shift in policy. He criticized this approach, noting, “Whole families can board a commercial flight on a travel loan backed by U.S. State Department funds.” Bensman emphasized that this program, though legal, is largely invisible and serves to increase refugee numbers without public scrutiny. He also touched on Panama’s new president promising to close the Darien Gap, a major migration route, but noted that the U.S. is not providing enough support. "The promised American support is falling short,” he said, adding that migration numbers through the Darien Gap remain high despite repatriation efforts.  Natalie Winters talks about her ideas for the proper use of Ukraine funding.  Natalie Winters talks about the level of betrayal of Liz Cheney endorsing radical Democrat Kamala Harris for President.  Noor Bin Laden criticized NATO for its role in promoting “cognitive warfare” while ironically naming its program after the same tactics it has long employed. She claimed NATO has been "weaponizing and devising narratives” to subvert political movements globally, including Ukraine and right-wing populist movements like Brexit and MAGA. Bin Laden highlighted the use of “disinformation” to undermine sovereign nations, pointing to globalist agendas supported by NATO and other institutions like the UN, which she believes are working together since their post-World War II inception. She further linked NATO to globalist efforts, suggesting that disinformation campaigns aim to erode national sovereignty. "They deploy these weapons because we stand in the way of their new world order,” she stated. Bin Laden also touched on how platforms like Twitter are manipulated under a "honey pot slash data mining operation,” casting doubt on Elon Musk’s actions regarding free speech. She underscored that understanding these techniques is key to resisting "globalism” and "communism 2.0.”  Sam Faddis has criticized the current narratives surrounding U.S. foreign policy and election integrity, calling them misleading and harmful. Faddis argues that the ongoing war in Ukraine, which he deems an opportunity for corporate profit, risks escalating into a larger conflict. “This policy…has us dancing right along the knife’s edge of a much bigger conflict and potentially a nuclear exchange,” he warns. He agrees with Donald Trump’s stance that a negotiated solution would end the conflict, emphasizing that “we can end this in effect anytime we want.” Addressing recent claims about Russian interference in U.S. politics, Faddis dismisses them as part of a “Russian collusion hoax.” He criticizes the portrayal of Trump as a Russian ally, stating that “anybody with common sense” would recognize Putin’s disinterest in dealing with Trump. Faddis also condemns the narrative that questions about election integrity are part of a Russian plot, arguing it serves to silence legitimate concerns. “If you raise any questions about the Integrity of the system you’re doing Putin’s bidding,” he asserts.  </div>
