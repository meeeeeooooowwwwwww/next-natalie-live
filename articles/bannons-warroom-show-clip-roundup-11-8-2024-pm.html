    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 11/8/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Mike Davis emphasized the need for aggressive oversight by Congress, especially concerning the Biden administration’s use of “lawfare” to target former President Trump. Davis supported House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan’s move to demand documents from Special Counsel Jack Smith, indicating that a special prosecutor might be necessary to investigate the perceived bias and interference in Trump-related prosecutions. He pointed to actions by officials connected to the Biden administration, alleging coordinated legal moves in various states to hinder Trump’s candidacy. Davis criticized the prolonged ballot counting in Democrat-controlled states, contrasting it with quicker processes in states like Florida. He argued that inconsistencies in election administration raise doubts about democracy’s integrity. He underscored the need for voter reform, including proof of citizenship and voter ID, to restore public confidence. Davis concluded by calling for a robust Congressional response to prevent law enforcement and intelligence agencies from allegedly acting against elected leaders. He urged Senators, particularly Chuck Grassley, to continue probing the origins of investigations into Trump, framing these actions as essential to protecting American democracy from undue influence.  Steve Bannon and Julie Kelly discuss Representative Jim Jordan’s recent letter to Special Counsel Jack Smith, instructing him to preserve documents related to alleged prosecutorial misconduct. Kelly, a long-time advocate for accountability in this area, highlights the significance of this move, especially considering ongoing legal controversies surrounding Trump’s case in Florida. She claims there is documented evidence of collusion between the Biden administration, DOJ officials, and the National Archives to target Trump. Kelly mentions instances of mishandled evidence, witness tampering, and threats, specifically calling out prosecutors Jay Bratt and David Harbach for alleged misconduct. She believes House Republicans should investigate these actions thoroughly and consider pursuing criminal charges. Additionally, Kelly points readers to her detailed reports on Smith’s alleged misconduct, emphasizing the need for serious oversight. She suggests that House and Senate Republicans must scrutinize these allegations to ensure accountability within the DOJ.  In this conversation about the Arizona Senate race, Caroline Wren and Steve Bannon discussed Kari Lake’s unexpectedly close contest with Katie Hobbs. Wren highlighted the efforts of Charlie Kirk and Tyler Bowyer, who have provided detailed, district-by-district updates, revealing that Lake could potentially secure a win as the vote count narrows. She pointed out that many outstanding ballots are in Maricopa County, an area favorable to Lake, making the race even tighter. Wren explained the focus on “ballot curing”—correcting issues with ballots to ensure they’re counted—and mentioned that several conservative groups are actively assisting with this process, resulting in high curing rates for Republican voters. Despite their efforts, she expressed frustration with Arizona’s slow vote-counting process, attributing delays to a lack of transparency and Governor Katie Hobbs’ veto of proposed reforms to improve ballot processing efficiency. With Senate leadership elections approaching, Wren speculated that delays may be aimed at preventing Lake’s timely participation. She called for financial support to prepare for a potential recount, stressing that even small contributions could make a difference in securing Lake’s victory.  Steve Bannon and Mike Davis discussed the potential retirement of Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Davis addressed rumors and Democratic calls for Sotomayor to step down, possibly allowing the Biden administration to appoint a replacement. Davis argued that Senate Republicans should halt any attempts to confirm new judicial nominees before they regain Senate control in January. He suggested Senator Mike Lee as a key figure to block any rapid confirmations by utilizing Senate procedures that allow a single senator to slow the process significantly. Davis supported the idea of Sotomayor remaining in her position, dismissing Democratic efforts to replace her with another liberal judge as partisan. He emphasized the importance of preserving the vacancy for a future Trump nominee, citing the Republican majority in the new Congress. The Article III Project, led by Davis, plans to help Trump secure judicial nominations if he reclaims the presidency, aiming to prevent any last-minute Biden appointees to lifetime judicial positions.  In this discussion between Steve Bannon and Bill McGinley, the two highlighted concerns about alleged Democratic efforts to undermine Republican victories and President Trump’s agenda. McGinley commented on the Pennsylvania race, where David McCormick appeared to have a substantial lead, suggesting Democrats are attempting to challenge election outcomes they dislike, portraying their actions as hypocritical “election denialism.” He argued that Democrats aim to prevent Republicans from securing future majorities by stirring controversy and leveraging dark money for legal battles. McGinley emphasized the strength of the coalition Trump built with working- and middle-class voters, saying it was instrumental in recent successes and could fortify Republican control in future Senate races. McGinley predicted a proactive approach from a potential Trump administration, aimed at reversing Biden-era policies through mechanisms like the Congressional Review Act. He voiced support for civil service reform to align federal workers with elected leadership. Citing conservative judiciary appointments as an advantage, he forecasted a strategic response to Democratic “resistance,” warning of midnight regulations and judicial nominations pushed by the Biden administration to impede a Republican agenda. The conversation underscored a belief in Trump’s mandate to reduce government overreach and pursue a populist agenda in the second term.
