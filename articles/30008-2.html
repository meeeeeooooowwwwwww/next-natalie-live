    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 9/13/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>In a War Room segment, John Mills warns of escalating tensions as Ukraine employs advanced missiles like the JASSM via F-16s, potentially provoking a severe Russian response. He calls this move “incredibly provocative” and cautions against further escalation. Mills also critiques the Biden administration’s approach to global conflicts, describing it as “provocative at the wrong time.” He points out that while Ukraine’s military maneuvers may be driven by fears of a Trump victory, the U.S. is acting from a “position of weakness.” Mills links economic struggles to geopolitical tensions, noting that the U.S. and China are engaged in “asymmetric warfare” targeting each other’s systems. He expresses concern over U.S. elites, including both Democrats and Republicans, being “captured” by Chinese influence, undermining America’s defense and fiscal stability. Mills emphasizes the need for the U.S. to act with “resolve, clarity, and strength” to protect the constitutional republic. Natalie Winter explains that based on her 2022 article, George Soros and China are funding election oversight groups in 2024.  Mike Howell discusses his ongoing investigations into illegal alien voting in swing states, highlighting issues similar to those found in North Carolina and Georgia. He states, “it’s like shooting fish in a barrel” due to how easy it is to find non-citizens registered to vote. Howell argues that illegal voter registration is a significant problem, despite media misinformation, and claims the U.S. is “in huge trouble” as the country faces an invasion. He also criticizes U.S. funding for UK disinformation studies, calling for the House Appropriations Committee to cut budgets for foreign censorship collaborations targeting free speech online.  Natalie Winters explains “RINOS” as Republicans who want to control the Republican Party for themselves and says they are not interested in Trump’s victory.  Mike Ben explains his use of “The Bob” to describe the intelligence agencies that appear to work against the American people in elections. He includes operations in the United Kingdom, which he claims are coordinated with American counterparts to impact elections and candidates.  Natalie Winters explains that the Department of Justice has been weaponized against Steve Bannon and he has been imprisoned to keep him quiet.  Ben Bergquam strongly criticizes the Biden administration, particularly Kamala Harris, for the failure to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, leading to severe humanitarian and security crises. He highlights the tragic issue of missing children, stating, “Many of them are dead. Many of them are sex slaves, and slaves of different nature.” According to Bergquam, the incomplete border wall east of Nogales, Arizona, is now controlled by cartels, and the lack of border patrol agents in the area underscores the severity of the situation. He points out that the cartels have operational control, with lookout points, armed men, and even solar panels to facilitate illegal crossings and drug smuggling. Bergquam specifically blames Kamala Harris and Joe Biden for this failure, asserting that their refusal to complete the wall has left the border wide open, allowing cartels to profit while American citizens suffer. “The reason this section of wall is not complete is because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris didn’t want it built,” he claims. He adds that the Democratic Party’s opposition to border security is not just policy-based but ideological, accusing them of chanting “no borders, no walls, no USA at all.” He connects this failure to broader issues, such as the rise in fentanyl deaths and violence caused by illegal aliens, and asserts that both Harris and Biden have turned a blind eye to the crisis. “If Kamala Harris and Joe Biden in any of these Democrats actually cared about kids, they would be talking about it. They would be undoing their policies that have invited this,” Bergquam argues, highlighting their lack of response to the ongoing tragedy. Bergquam also recounts his own experience witnessing cartel activity at the border, describing cartel bunkers and drug mules preparing to cross into the U.S., which only stopped when he was present. He warns that if the current administration and their policies remain in place, “we’re screwed as a country,” but expresses hope that the American people are waking up to the situation and will take action in the next election. His closing message is a call for unity in defending the values that make America great.  Sabin Howard, a renowned sculptor, reflects on his nine-year journey creating the National World War I Memorial, “A Soldier’s Journey,” highlighting its larger significance. "Today’s not about me, this sculpture is not about me. I am in service of something way larger than myself,” Sabin remarks. His journey began from humble beginnings, starting at age 19 without even knowing what a portfolio was, and now, 41 years later, he’s completed this monumental 60-foot-long, 38-figure composition. The sculpture draws inspiration from the experiences of veterans, symbolizing "our unlimited potential as human beings” and incorporating elements of nobility, suffering, and healing. Sabin emphasizes that this artwork is for the public: "This sculpture is for you… It is about human beings, every single aspect in expression of how we feel.” His wife and project manager, Rachel, questions him on the parallels between his personal and artistic journeys. Sabin explains that the experience taught him to "believe in the sacred” and create a work that elevates people and embodies American cultural excellence, reflecting on the veterans who served as models and the spiritual transformation the project brought him. Part ONE:  Part Two:  Part THREE: In the second part of their conversation, Sabin Howard and his wife Rachel discuss the upcoming unveiling of the National World War I Memorial and its impact. Sabin emphasizes the sculpture’s deep human connection, describing it as a way of bringing people together. “I’ve taken art, putting it in your hands,” he says, noting the sculpture’s role in fostering unity. Reflecting on the horrors of war, Sabin recalls a childhood memory of seeing a stark image from the Vietnam War, which continues to shape his artistic vision. He discusses the destructive forces threatening societal cohesion and how his work aims to counter that by creating art that highlights interconnectedness. Sabin points out that the sculpture’s themes of suffering, sacrifice, and healing are universal, adding, "We are all made in God’s image.” Sabin also stresses the importance of preserving history through monuments, warning that erasing historical memory can lead to societal decay. He sees his art as a way to inspire and unite people, aspiring to create more memorials that celebrate American exceptionalism. The memorial, Sabin hopes, will “rebuild our country with beauty,” focusing on humanity and resilience over destruction.  Part FOUR: </div>
