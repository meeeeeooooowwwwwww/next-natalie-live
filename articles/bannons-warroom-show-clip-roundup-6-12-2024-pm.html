    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 6/12/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>US Rep. Andy Biggs and Steve Bannon discussed the recent historic decision by the House of Representatives to hold the US Attorney General in contempt of Congress. This rare event, only the third in US history, occurred due to the Attorney General’s failure to comply with subpoenas from three committees despite numerous opportunities provided. Biggs highlighted the importance of obtaining audio recordings from interviews conducted by Special Counsel Robert Hur with Joe Biden and his biographer, which reportedly contain evidence of Biden’s mishandling of classified information. Biggs criticized Hur’s decision not to prosecute Biden, citing concerns about Biden’s memory and the potential sympathy of a jury. The Congressman emphasized the need to review the audio tapes to verify the validity of Hur’s prosecutorial discretion and to consider impeachment proceedings against Biden. Biggs argued that the Department of Justice’s refusal to release the tapes suggests a political cover-up and insisted that Congress has the constitutional right to access the evidence. The discussion also covered the procedural next steps, including the possibility of appointing a special House counsel to pursue civil action if necessary. Biggs stressed the need for aggressive oversight and accountability, particularly in light of the perceived weaponization of the federal government against conservatives. He called for more assertive actions to restore balance and ensure the rule of law.   Julie Kelly, speaking with Steve Bannon, praised the House Republicans and leadership for holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress, marking only the third time this has happened. Kelly emphasized that this action will draw public attention to Garland’s refusal to release the audio recordings of Joe Biden’s interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur. She argued that this is among the least of Garland’s offenses, citing his history of weaponizing the Justice Department against figures like Donald Trump and January 6th protesters. Kelly criticized the Justice Department’s handling of the classified documents case in Florida, describing it as corrupt and sloppy. She mentioned the mishandling of evidence during the Mar-A-Lago raid, including alleged doctoring of photos and improper handling of privileged communications. Bannon and Kelly discussed the parallels between Biden’s situation and Trump’s, suggesting the Biden audio tapes must be damaging for Garland to risk contempt charges. Additionally, Kelly highlighted Garland’s attempts to conceal evidence, including January 6th security footage, which Republicans are now making public. She underscored Garland’s double standards and his efforts to shield critical information from the American people. The conversation briefly touched on the ongoing legal proceedings involving Trump, including motions to dismiss the Mar-A-Lago case due to alleged mishandling and falsification of the search warrant.  Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters discussed the recent decision to hold US Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress, highlighting it as a significant and overdue step. Winters expressed satisfaction with the move but stressed that many more individuals need to be held accountable, such as the 51 intelligence officers who she claims lied. She criticized the current process of private depositions and slow release of information, advocating for public hearings with meaningful questions. Winters argued that House Republicans must push for real accountability and avoid the limited actions that only give the appearance of progress. She drew attention to what she perceives as a double standard, where Republicans face harsher scrutiny for defying Congressional subpoenas compared to Democrats. Bannon and Winters agreed that what is needed is not retribution but justice.  Mike Lindell and Steve Bannon discussed recent developments in the recall effort against Robin Voss in Wisconsin. Lindell announced that a significant legal filing had been made by lawyer Kevin Scott, which mandates the Wisconsin Election Commission to set the recall election for July 9th. Lindell emphasized the importance of this recall, stating that Voss has blocked numerous efforts to secure election integrity and reforms, particularly those addressing issues from the 2020 election. Removing Voss, according to Lindell, would open doors for the MAGA movement and broader Republican efforts in Wisconsin. The conversation then shifted briefly to promotional deals on Lindell’s products, including discounts on mattresses with a six-month money-back guarantee and a 10-year warranty. Lindell urged viewers to take advantage of these deals by visiting his website or calling a provided phone number.  In their discussion, Steve Bannon and EJ Antoni reviewed the latest inflation figures and their impact on American consumers. Antoni noted that while the inflation rate has slowed to 3.3%, prices are still rising faster than wages, causing a decline in purchasing power. He criticized the accuracy of government metrics, particularly in areas like health insurance, which do not reflect the real experiences of most Americans. Antoni emphasized that many Americans are financially worse off, as indicated by various polls. Bannon and Antoni then discussed the economic impact of the increasing number of illegal immigrants, arguing that while these immigrants contribute to production, they also incur significant costs (e.g., using emergency rooms and public schools without adequately contributing to tax revenues). They highlighted that consumer spending, a major component of GDP, has turned negative, suggesting a potential decline in GDP for the second quarter. The conversation also touched on the high levels of consumer credit card debt, which exceeds $1 trillion, with rising default rates. Antoni explained that many consumers have maxed out their credit and are struggling to maintain their standard of living. They drew parallels between consumer reliance on credit and government borrowing strategies, noting that both are unsustainable in the long term. Antoni pointed out that real-life costs, such as homeownership, have increased far more than official metrics indicate. He highlighted that the net job growth has largely gone to foreign workers since the pandemic, with fewer native-born Americans employed today than before February 2020. To follow Antoni’s economic analysis, Bannon recommended his Twitter feed and Heritage Foundation’s website.  Steve Bannon and Malachy Steenson discussed the rise of nationalist and populist movements in Europe, particularly focusing on the European Parliamentary elections. Bannon highlighted the significant role of figures like Nigel Farage in the UK and the activities of nationalist parties across France and Germany. He emphasized the importance of following these movements closely. Steenson provided an in-depth look at the situation in Ireland, emphasizing the country’s historical commitment to sovereignty and nationalism. He criticized the current political class in Ireland for their alignment with the European Union and their handling of immigration issues. Steenson highlighted the significant impact of recent immigration policies on local communities, particularly the strain on housing and public services. Both Bannon and Steenson expressed concern over the erosion of national identity and sovereignty due to the influence of the EU and the influx of migrants. Steenson pointed out the unsustainability of current immigration levels given Ireland’s limited infrastructure and resources. He noted the revival of nationalist sentiment in Ireland, driven by the perceived betrayal of the political class and the pressure from increasing immigration. They discussed the potential for a general election in Ireland, speculating it might occur later this year. Steenson emphasized the need for a grassroots nationalist movement to reclaim Ireland’s sovereignty and protect its cultural identity for future generations. Bannon underscored the importance of such movements globally, noting similar sentiments rising in various countries.  Steve Bannon and Ben Harnwell discussed significant political developments in the United States and Europe, emphasizing the rise of nationalist and populist movements. Bannon highlighted concerns about political threats, referencing comments from Kash Patel and criticisms from “Morning Joe,” stressing the seriousness of threats from political opponents. They criticized Donald Trump’s character and suitability for a second term, pointing to his authoritarian tendencies and disregard for constitutional norms. Harnwell updated on political shifts in France, noting Eric Ciotti’s support for Marine Le Pen’s National Rally, a major change in French politics that challenges traditional separations between mainstream and nationalist parties. This potential collaboration could significantly impact European politics, particularly in the upcoming European elections, reflecting a broader trend of growing nationalist influence. Additionally, Harnwell emphasized the importance of grassroots support and engagement, highlighting the enthusiasm of MAGA supporters and noting that interventions from establishment figures like Paul Ryan only galvanize this base. Overall, the discussion underscored the increasing influence of nationalist and populist movements, the shifts in political alliances, and their potential impact on future elections and governance. </div>
