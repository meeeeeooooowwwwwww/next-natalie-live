    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 5 Feb 25 [AM]</h1>
    <div>Steve Bannon, Dave Brat, and Natalie Winters discussed Republican resistance efforts on Capitol Hill, highlighting legal and bureaucratic obstacles. They noted that establishment forces are using lawsuits and liberal courts to slow down conservative initiatives. A key focus was dismantling the FBI and USAID, which they claim funds left-wing agendas, including suppressing conservative media, supporting the southern border crisis, and covert operations in Ukraine. Winters emphasized the scale of opposition, mentioning a 50,000-strong mobilization. Bannon framed the fight as an all-out offensive, using wartime metaphors. They also touched on concerns regarding data mining and AI in government operations. The discussion underscored conservative frustration with entrenched institutions and their determination to overhaul the system.  Steve Bannon outlined key Republican priorities, emphasizing the need for strategic execution. He framed the political battle as a structured process, requiring discipline before achieving larger victories. Bannon identified three major objectives: ending U.S. involvement in global conflicts (particularly Ukraine and the Middle East), addressing mass illegal immigration through “nasty partitions” to remove millions of migrants since 2021, and tackling the financial crisis driven by $36 trillion in national debt. He criticized excessive federal spending, advocating for targeted tax reforms that benefit middle-class entrepreneurs rather than corporations. While supporting defense spending, he argued for a strategic overhaul to prevent self-inflicted economic harm. He highlighted Trump’s “geo-economic and geostrategic” vision, focusing on protectionism and hemispheric defense. Bannon also referenced internal Republican debates over budget cuts, particularly leading up to a March 14 deadline that could determine whether Trump shuts down his own government. He framed these financial battles as existential, warning of elite corruption and unchecked spending.  Steve Bannon and Dave Brat discussed key financial and political issues, focusing on government spending, fiscal policy, and economic control. Bannon highlighted Jason Turner’s appointment as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Markets, emphasizing its significance. Brat, known for his economic expertise, shared complex mathematical analyses regarding financial trends. Bannon underscored concerns about excessive government spending, deficits, and inflation. He noted that gold prices hit an all-time high due to the weakening dollar, attributing the decline in purchasing power to reckless federal expenditures. Bill Ackman and Elon Musk’s perspectives were cited, reinforcing the argument that current deficit levels are unsustainable. Bannon stressed the need for spending cuts and budget restructuring, explaining that Trump’s administration would approach financial control through executive actions, including delaying payments and reallocating funds. The discussion also touched on legislative challenges, particularly the Republican Party’s struggle to push serious budget reforms. Concerns over fragmented efforts in the Senate and donor-driven decision-making were highlighted, with emphasis on border security and tax cuts. Bannon warned that Democrats, despite current setbacks, still have significant resources, including media influence. He concluded by discussing Trump’s financial strategy, suggesting that controlling spending requires firm executive action. He argued that the judiciary would ultimately decide the extent of executive power in financial restructuring. Overall, the conversation reflected deep frustration with Washington’s fiscal mismanagement and a call for aggressive reforms.  Jim Rickards and Steve Bannon discussed the dire situation in Ukraine, emphasizing the need for a strategic shift. Rickards criticized Ukraine’s current approach, including Zelensky’s demands for more aid and military support, and questioned the effectiveness of NATO’s involvement. He warned against the continued supply of ineffective weapons, like Abrams tanks and F-16s, which have failed on the battlefield. Rickards argued that Ukraine has lost the war and suggested that the U.S. should stop escalating the conflict. He proposed three options: accept Putin’s terms, continue fighting for better terms (which he deemed unlikely), or escalate to World War III. He advised that President Trump could end the war quickly with a phone call, but feared that advisors might push for a prolonged conflict to secure better terms. Rickards recommended cutting bait now, negotiating directly with Putin, and telling Zelensky the terms. He also criticized Zelensky’s leadership, calling him a military dictator rather than a democratic leader. Bannon agreed with Rickards’ assessment, emphasizing the importance of a free-market system in Ukraine and rejecting elitist interventions that hinder economic growth. Bannon also highlighted Ukraine’s Christian values, suggesting a more balanced approach to foreign policy, focusing on economic independence rather than globalist agendas. Finally, they briefly touched on the financial situation and upcoming changes in the U.S. Treasury, with Rickards promoting his new book, Money GPT, addressing AI’s impact on financial markets and global conflict. Part One:  Part Two:  Steve Bannon and Dave Brat discuss the current financial crisis and the challenges facing Congress in managing the budget. Bannon highlights the looming debt ceiling and the need for immediate action, stressing the importance of addressing tax issues and warning against ignoring letters from the IRS. He emphasizes the urgency of fiscal reform, particularly in light of the growing deficit and the inability of Congress to act effectively. Brat reflects on the unsustainable increase in federal spending, pointing out that the budget has grown from $4.5 trillion in 2019 to $6.5 trillion, without addressing the long-term debt problem. He advocates for imposing fiscal rules that would constrain government spending and limit deficits. Both express frustration with the lack of leadership in Congress, particularly in the House, and the failure to move forward on appropriations bills. They criticize the Senate’s inaction and call for stronger political will to tackle the fiscal crisis. Bannon also touches on the impact of artificial intelligence on the economy, warning that it could further enrich the wealthy while hurting the middle class. In closing, both agree that leadership and a unified approach are needed to address these pressing fiscal challenges.  Swearing in Attorney General Pam Bondi. </div>
