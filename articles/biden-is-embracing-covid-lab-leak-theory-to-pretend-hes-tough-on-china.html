    <h1>Biden Is Embracing COVID Lab Leak Theory To Pretend He’s Tough On China</h1>
    <div>“War Room” executive editor Natalie Winters talks to host Steve Bannon about the two-years-late assessment by the Biden administration that Covid-19 was the result of a Chinese lab leak. “The Chinese spy balloon really really exposed the Biden regime’s pretty evident weakness on the Chinese Communist Party, but it’s almost so in your face that they now have to … come out and pretend to be tough on the Chinese Communist Party… which as we know is a position the Biden regime could never actually hold… because of the compromise they have at the hands of Hunter Biden. and obviously Joe Biden’s political career.”  </div>
