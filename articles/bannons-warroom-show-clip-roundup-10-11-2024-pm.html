    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 10/11/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Natalie Winters discussed her theories about a looming disinformation censorship campaign, a House memo on misinformation on social media, Barack Obama, and children being taught to identify misinformation.  Jeff Lark and Eric Teetsel from the Center for Renewing America reacted to an Axios article. They confirmed that they believe Democrats will allow them to skip the certification process when President Trump wins.  Tom Fitton from Judicial Watch group discussed their efforts to ensure election integrity and combat corruption in government. Judicial Watch has been actively involved in legal battles to clean up voter rolls, leading to the removal of over four million names across the country. Fitton emphasized the importance of states maintaining accurate voter rolls, stating, “You just can’t be mailing out ballots to dirty lists.” Fitton also criticized the Biden administration’s spending on illegal immigration while neglecting American citizens, particularly in crises, calling it “an invasion” that undermines the country. He expressed frustration with Congress for not fulfilling their oversight responsibilities, saying, “They do some hearings, but a lot more needs to be done.” Judicial Watch is also involved in lawsuits exposing “woke” DEI mandates in military academies, which Fitton argued are alienating future military leaders by promoting left-wing ideologies. He underscored the need to fight back against these policies, calling them “outrageously taught.” Fitton concluded by urging the public to stay informed about Judicial Watch’s work, stating that their fight on these essential issues is critical to “the future of the country.”  Brandon Straka provided an update on his latest work with the WalkAway campaign, emphasizing the continued exodus from the Democratic Party. He released a new video, a “sequel” to his original WalkAway video, highlighting the erosion of freedoms, culture, and voting systems under Democratic leadership. Straka explained, "We’re texting one million undecided voters in swing states,” with a focus on racial minorities, pointing to Obama’s recent attempt to sway Black men toward Kamala Harris. He noted that people are increasingly questioning traditional generational voting patterns, particularly in minority communities. Straka discussed how fear, instilled by left-wing media, keeps many loyal to the Democratic Party. His outreach includes minority town halls and educational videos to challenge media narratives. He also mentioned that the WalkAway movement now includes high-profile figures, like Cherie Currie and Susan Olsen, leaving Hollywood and speaking out against the left’s “woke agenda.” Straka concluded by encouraging people to join the movement, stating, "I don’t want to be part of the further degradation of our country.”  Tina Desovich, co-founder of Moms for Liberty, shared her thoughts on the media’s push of transgender ideology, particularly in schools. She highlighted alarming statistics, noting, "Five and a half percent of American students are either identifying as transgender or questioning their gender,” calling it an epidemic. Desovich expressed concern over schools teaching children as young as four that they can change their gender, saying, "When you send your child to public school, what are they teaching them about their gender?” She emphasized the role of Moms for Liberty in empowering parents to reclaim control over their children’s education, medical care, and religion. The organization provides resources and tools, including model policies for school districts, to counteract gender ideology. Desovich also discussed Moms for Liberty’s involvement in a lawsuit challenging the Biden Administration’s Title IX rewrite, which they argue undermines protections for girls’ sports and spaces. "We’ve had over 5,000 schools exempt from applying the new Title IX rewrite,” she stated. Desovich reaffirmed the group’s mission to "unify, educate, and empower” parents to protect their children’s rights and education from what she sees as an overreach by schools and the state.  Brian Kennedy emphasized the ongoing concern over election integrity in the U.S., stating, “A lot of Americans think the 2020 election was stolen, maybe half the country.” He noted that despite efforts from groups like Judicial Watch, the system has not significantly changed as the country heads toward the 2024 election. However, Kennedy expressed more confidence in the current state of election systems in key swing states like Georgia and Pennsylvania, which he believes are improved from 2020. He also echoed President Trump’s approach, saying that in 2024, the focus should be on making the election "too big to rig.” Kennedy criticized Vice President Kamala Harris as a weak candidate, stating, "The more she’s on television, the worse it gets.” He predicted a “suppressed” Democratic vote and an overwhelming turnout for Trump, fueled by dissatisfaction with the current administration and strong support for Trump. Kennedy urged everyone to encourage their friends and family to vote, describing it as a “clarion call” for those who believe in human decency. </div>
