    <h1>Natalie Winters Exposes Twitter's Trust & Safety Dir. Yoel Roth Defending Pedophile Anthony Weiner As A 'Saint' In Deleted Blog Post.</h1>
    <div>“War Room” co-host Natalie Winters talks to Steve Bannon about her latest story, which highlights the warped thinking of Twitter’s former “director of trust and safety” Yoel Roth. Oh yeah, and Winters also reacts to the holier-than-thou farewell tour of Dr. Anthony Fauci. “What we uncovered today on Warroom.org is just another example of what I would call a checkered past [for Yoel Roth]… This man has a weird affinity of defending pedophiles and making it a lot easier for older men to interact with … teenagers… What I uncovered today was a blog post from 2011… It was titled ‘Anthony Weiner, Manhunt, and the Behaviors of Single People.’ [In 2011, Weiner was caught engaging in inappropriate online relationships with several women he had met on the internet despite being married to longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin]”   </div>
