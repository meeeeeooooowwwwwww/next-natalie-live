    <h1>Kyiv Post Calls Steve Bannon ‘Criminal’ Amid WarRoom’s Resolute Stand Against Ukraine Funding</h1>
    <div>In his recent critique of the WarRoom in the Kyiv post, “The Enemy Within the US Is Letting Russia Get Away With Murder,” Askold S. Lozynskyj aims at Steve Bannon, sparking a clash over who will be investigated for wrongdoing over Ukraine funding, Americans or Ukrainians. The WarRoom program, hosted by Bannon and his co-host Natalie Winters, is to many Americans a remnant beacon of liberty and hope and their final opportunity to defend what remains of a Constitutional Republic. To others, the WarRoom program is nothing more than a danger to the New World Order. “You are described in the article as an extremist and a criminal; Steve and I was overjoyed because that means that the momentum you are pushing is taking effect,” said Ben Harnwell, the WarRoom international editor, addressing the article on the Saturday program. Bannon responded and rebuffed the attacks from the Kyiv Post, saying that the author and the oligarchs in Ukraine can “stick it where the sun doesn’t shine.” Bannon and his persistent audience on the WarRoom staunchly oppose using American taxpayer dollars to support the Ukraine war. This bold stance has led Lozynskyj to brand Bannon a “criminal” and suggest US Reps should be investigated for their opposition to sending more money to Ukraine, saying it is somehow unAmerican to oppose the wealth transfer. What is evident from the article, according to Harnwell,  is that Bannon and the War Room, who even have their own activism tools for opposing Ukraine spending, are now openly feared internationally as political powerhouses. This week, Bannon’s mission remains unwavering as the WarRoom resolutely opposes the US House allocating an additional $61 billion to Ukraine. Bannon asserts that the WarRoom action is unsettling war profiteers who are misusing funds for luxuries and that criticism is evident in the sharp personal attacks launched by media outlets as a consequence. Thus, the Kyiv Post article exposes the government-media alliance that Bannon is legendary for exposing in the US. Despite the nasty Kyiv criticism, Bannon remains steadfast in his commitment to addressing the Ukrainian situation. He emphasizes accountability for how American taxpayer money is spent. The WarRoom host vows that once back in power, there will be a thorough investigation into the allocation of funds, hinting at potential criminal charges for those involved. Bannon says the investigations will also sweep up the country’s president and oligarchs. On Saturday, Harnwell, highlighted the disconnect between Bannon’s loyalty to the America First agenda and the accusations levied against him. Harnwell argues that the focus should remain on prioritizing American interests over external needs and wants, even for the author who was born in the US, as Harnwell points out. Lozynskyj’s criticism includes US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, whom he depicts as obstructing efforts to combat Russian aggression. The article suggests investigating Greene and US Senator JD Vance for their opposition to funding Ukraine, portraying them as hindrances to American interests. Those Americans who are skeptical of funding foreign wars are labeled “Putin’s useful idiots,” insinuating that their actions align with Moscow’s agenda rather than America’s. As the political debate over Ukraine funding rages on, Bannon, the WarRoom, and their supporters will likely remain steadfast in their resistance to spreading taxpayer funds to the region, challenging the DC status quo, and advocating for American interests, regardless of the criticism they face from the Kyiv Post.
