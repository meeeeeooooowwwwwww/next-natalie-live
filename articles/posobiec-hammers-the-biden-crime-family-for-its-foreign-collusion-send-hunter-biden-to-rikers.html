    <h1>Posobiec Hammers The Biden Crime Family For Its Foreign Collusion: "Send Hunter Biden To Rikers"</h1>
    <div>Political analyst Jack Posobiec talks to guest host Natalie Winters about the latest attempt by the mainstream media to wash away the guilt of the Biden family in using Joe Biden’s political position to create power and wealth for the family. The New York Times makes excuses for the Bidens in the new story about “Hunter Biden’s tangled tale.” “The whole thing is an absolute mess, but … from the perspective of a New York Times reader this is the first time you may have understood or heard any of this information.. so they’re giving them the ability then to respond to anyone who’s in this War Room posse… because we’ve had the facts for years now.. This is finally  their pitiful … attempt to try to respond because we know at the end of the day, this is going to be swept under the table. And here’s the thing folks, it’s not hypocrisy; it’s hierarchy. When you’re a Democrat, they let you do it.”  </div>
