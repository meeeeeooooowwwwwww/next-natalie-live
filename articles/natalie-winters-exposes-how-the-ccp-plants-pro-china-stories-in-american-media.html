    <h1>Natalie Winters Exposes How The CCP Plants Pro-China Stories In American Media</h1>
    <div>“War Room” executive editor Natalie Winters talks to host Steve Bannon about the dangerous relationship between the American media and the Chinese Communist Party, using an article in Politico by Jon Bateman as Exhibit A. “This article is titled ‘The Fevered Anti-China Attitude in Washington Is Going to Backfire.’ Even thought the byline says it is by Jon Bateman, it very well could have been authored by the Chinese Communist Party…. The talking points that run through it are straight from Beijing…. What’s so interesting is … this is a perfect example of how the Chinese Communist Party really launders their talking points through American talking heads.”  </div>
