    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 3/27/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>HIGHLIGHTS: Wednesday’s show explored MSNBC’s turmoil over Ronna McDaniels’s brief tenure and the rescinding of Rhonda Romney McDaniel’s hiring, inciting reactions from Universal News Group staff.  Host Steve Bannon dissected Trump’s appeal to working-class Democrats and the establishment’s backlash. Discussions also touched on immigration’s impact on housing and the pushback against EV regulations, highlighting ongoing political battles. From concerns over illegal immigrant housing to strategies for the 2024 election, the show offered a panoramic view of America’s political landscape. As Bannon emphasized the need for grassroots resistance, guests like Louis Murray and Catherine O’Neill brought local activism and entrepreneurial spirit to the forefront, reflecting diverse perspectives. Natalie Winters and Brittany Martinez discussed Evie Magazine’s scrutiny over birth control side effects, attributing it to political agendas and censorship and she spoke with Dave Walsh about energy policies Americans need to focus on. Full show in segments: Wednesday’s night show opened with a clip of MSNBC talking heads discussing the devolution of Ronna McDaniels’s employment at the network, lasting less than two days, without fury raging through the MSNBC crew.  The show opens with a discussion about a memo circulated within Universal News Group, authored by Conde, announcing the rescinding of Rhonda Romney McDaniel’s hiring, causing solid reactions among employees, including Joe Ried and Rachel Madow. MSNBC’s Charlie Sykes appeared in the clip, highlighting the establishment’s opposition to Trump, rallying behind Biden, while working-class Democrats are embracing Trump’s disruptive message, as Bannon pointed out. Bannon said voters would focus on the convergence of crises, referring to US southern border issues, federal spending, and geopolitical tensions, adding that those issues would fuel the working class’s support for Trump. Bannon talked about how the establishment, symbolized by figures like Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, faces rejection by the new Republican base. The establishment’s strategy, underscored by recent efforts in Ukraine, relies on unconventional methods, potentially involving legal maneuvers orchestrated by Obama-era officials. Bannon pointed to reports that suggest Obama’s direct involvement in White House affairs, indicating a concerted effort to counter Trump’s resurgence, with Matthew Calandra playing a pivotal role. This intricate web of political maneuvering underscores the ongoing power struggle within the Republican Party and the broader political landscape.  Outside the Massachusetts State Capitol, as Bannon interviewed him, a group of about 25 individuals, including Lou Murray, is taking an early lunch break amid concerns over the state budget. Layoffs of teachers are imminent in four primary school systems. At the same time, the government plans to allocate an additional two billion dollars towards housing illegal immigrants in hotels, exploiting the state’s right-to-shelter policy. According to recent statistics, the immigration influx, numbering around 288,000, exacerbates the existing housing crisis and strains public resources. Residents who witness their tax dollars being funneled into providing free services for immigrants while essential community resources suffer grow dissatisfied. Murray discussed concerns that community centers are being displaced from urban areas to affluent suburbs. However, Murray told Bannon that efforts to raise awareness and mobilize action face challenges, including the co-optation of activists and community leaders. Murray said Governor Moore Healy’s recent announcement of tolls on commuters crossing the Cape Cod Canal adds to the economic burdens of blue-collar workers traveling to Boston for employment. Despite these challenges, grassroots activism persists, with individuals like Murray advocating for change and utilizing social media platforms like Twitter to amplify their voices and engage with the broader community.  In the following segment, Bannon said the opposition’s strategy revolves around allocating two billion dollars to challenge Trump in battleground states, focusing on 25 critical counties. Biden intends to leverage administrative power, including the deep state and a massive propaganda machine, to sway public opinion. Despite missed opportunities, such as not utilizing Danielle Pletka effectively, aiming to delegitimize Biden’s presidency, recognizing growing discontent among Americans, particularly regarding immigration policies and the southern border crisis. The media is a vital tool in propaganda efforts, controlled by powerful interests in Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and corporate elites. However, Bannon says, grassroots movements continue to resist, emphasizing the rigged nature of the political system and the need for accountability. Bannon anticipates turbulent times ahead but remains committed to exposing and confronting the corruption within the establishment.  Bannon talked about the frustration with the situation in New York around Trump’s lawfare cases and added the dangers posed by illegal immigration, citing a case where an illegal immigrant on TikTok instructed others on how to squat in the country. Bannon criticizes the Biden administration’s handling of immigration issues, seeing it as part of a broader effort to transform America. Despite recognizing Trump’s efforts, he stressed the need for collective action and volunteerism to counter the opposition’s tactics, which include legal maneuvers and propaganda. Bannon argued that Trump’s policies are vital for restoring America’s prosperity and security, contrasting them with what they perceive as the opposition’s nostalgia trap. The speaker emphasizes resilience in the face of challenges and vows to continue fighting against perceived injustices and corruption within the establishment.  Mike Davis talked about the judge overseeing Trump’s financial case who has issued a gag order following Trump’s public statements, deeming them threatening and inflammatory. The judge expressed concern about potential witness intimidation. Meanwhile, reports indicate that Obama is exerting influence over Biden’s administration, aiming to prosecute Trump. Matthew Colangelo, from the Biden Justice Department, is tasked with leading the case against Trump, which some see as politically motivated. The prosecution aims to vilify Trump, focusing on issues related to women and portraying him as a misogynist. Critics argue that this case infringes on Trump’s First Amendment and due process rights and suspect a broader conspiracy against Trump. Despite skepticism, the speaker believes that Trump’s resilience will prevail, and they call for continued advocacy to support Trump’s cause.  Despite Donald Trump’s apparent control over the Republican Party and its grassroots support, there is notable dissent within the party’s ranks, particularly among prominent figures like senators and former party leaders. Many senators, including Mitt Romney and Liz Cheney, have publicly stated their refusal to support Trump’s bid for re-election. This level of opposition from within the party is unprecedented in American history, with only Sarah Palin among recent Republican nominees publicly supporting Trump. In the clip Bannon shows, there is a suggestion that Trump’s control of the party may not be as absolute as it seems, pointing to these cracks in his support.  Catherine O’Neill, a former White House and State Department member, joins the discussion with Bannon. She expresses her commitment to fighting for clean and healthy food supplies amid challenges from large food corporations promoting radical environmentalism. She highlights her company, Meriweather Farms, based in Wyoming, which offers high-quality beef products. O’Neill emphasizes their dedication to providing various affordable options and encourages people to visit their website, www.maryweatherfarms.com, to learn more and place orders. Steve Bannon praises her entrepreneurial spirit and encourages listeners to support her efforts.  Steve Bannon discusses the strategies opponents employ to undermine Trump’s influence and the upcoming joint efforts of the Democratic Party, led by Obama, to counter Trump’s expanding coalition. He highlights concerns about the integrity of the 2020 election and criticizes Jim Jordan’s response to questions about it. Bannon emphasizes the importance of defending the constitutional republic and restoring stability and prosperity under Trump’s leadership. He concludes by expressing pride in the individuals and brands aligned with Trump’s cause.  Steve Bannon and Joshua Philipp discuss developments regarding illegal immigration and squatter rights in the United States. They highlight a video where an individual advocates for stealing homes from Americans and discusses the implications of squatter rights laws. Philipp explains the Biden administration’s role in facilitating mass illegal immigration through agreements like the Global Compact for Migration and describes the process migrants follow to enter the country. They also touch on the impact of a Chinese production aimed at influencing Americans’ perceptions of China. Throughout the conversation, they emphasize the need for awareness and action to address these issues.  Natalie Winters discusses with Brittany Martinez the attacks Evie Magazine has faced for highlighting the side effects of birth control pills. Martinez explains that the magazine began discussing these side effects in 2019, prompting backlash from both the left and the right. However, after the COVID-19 pandemic, their opposition intensified, with mainstream publications like Rolling Stone, Vice, and Jezebel publishing hit pieces against them. Martinez suggests that this increased scrutiny may be tied to political agendas akin to the censorship faced during discussions about COVID-19 vaccines. She emphasizes the importance of recognizing the broader agenda behind these attacks, suggesting that they may aim to silence women’s voices and perpetuate Big Pharma’s influence. Martinez also discusses how birth control pills affect women’s hormonal cycles, potentially influencing their behavior and decision-making. She highlights the need for women to understand their cycles and challenges misconceptions about birth control and fertility. Martinez invites people to follow her on Twitter (@Britt_Martinez) and encourages them to follow Evie Magazine for more information.  Thayer discusses the influence of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and their corruption. He emphasizes the CCP’s lack of legitimacy and characterizes it as a colonial government imposed by Western intellectual colonialism. Thayer advocates for exposing the CCP’s corruption and identifying its weaknesses to pave the way for its overthrow, allowing the Chinese people to determine their own form of government. He highlights the wealth of the CCP leadership as a target for scrutiny and emphasizes the need to reveal the regime’s hypocrisy. Navarro also mentions climate engineering programs and elite capture as significant issues. He criticizes Scotland’s new hate crime law as a step toward totalitarianism, influenced by the CCP’s model of control. Navarro concludes by discussing the importance of the upcoming election in countering the CCP’s influence operations and thwarting their broader goals.  The conversation revolves around the concept of the “Great Replacement Theory” and its application in various policies, particularly in the state of Michigan. Darren Beattie discusses how this theory, often considered controversial, is grounded in truth and needs to be addressed openly. Beattie draws parallels between immigration policies, the Chinese Communist Party’s influence, and the erosion of native populations in Western countries. He highlights a policy in Michigan known as the “newcomer renter subsidy,” which effectively subsidizes renters who are recent immigrants or even illegal immigrants, criticizing the policy for favoring newcomers over native citizens, including veterans, and emphasizing the perverse nature of such government actions. The discussion also touches upon broader themes of Western derangement and the erosion of traditional values and demographics.  The conversation explores various aspects of energy policy, mainly focusing on electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources. Dave Walsh discusses recent developments in EV regulations, including proposals to mandate a certain percentage of new vehicle sales to be electric by 2032. He critiques the efficacy of EVs, highlighting that despite being labeled as “zero emissions,” they are still powered predominantly by fossil fuels due to the energy grid’s composition. Electric power generation and transmission inefficiency is also emphasized, with comparisons made to gasoline-powered vehicles. Furthermore, the discussion addresses the environmental and geopolitical implications of transitioning to renewable energy sources. The guests expressed concerns about the dependency on China for battery production and the environmental impact of mining lithium and other materials necessary for EV batteries. They also touch upon the economic and strategic implications of energy policies in the context of global conflicts, particularly referencing the situation in Ukraine and its impact on European energy supplies. Additionally, there is criticism of the lack of understanding and depth among Congressional Republicans regarding energy issues, with a call for more excellent education on the subject. The conversation concludes with the guest providing contact information for those interested in following their work.</div>
