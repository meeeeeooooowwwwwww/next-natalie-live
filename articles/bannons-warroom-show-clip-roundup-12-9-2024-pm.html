    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 12/9/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Natalie Winters highlighted the numerous successes of the WarRoom audience.  Joe Allen discussed the most recent details known about the Assassin who killed the United HealthCare CEO in New York City in early December.  Natalie Winters talked to Mike Benz about the details of his investigation into the overthrow of Assad and his leadership in Syria.  Julie Kelly talked about the shocking case of an 81 year old who attended events at the US Capitol on Jan 6 2021 and who was sentenced to one year confinement in a Federal Prison.  Jacqueline Tobroff talked about the Acquittal of Daniel Penny, who stood trial for killing a man in New York City.  Steve Bannon and Yoram Hazony discussed pivotal geopolitical shifts in the Middle East and their implications. Bannon noted the escalating pressure on the Iranian regime following a series of setbacks, including the weakening of its proxies like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, as well as the Assad regime in Syria. Hazony attributed these developments to decisive military actions by Israel under Prime Minister Netanyahu, which demonstrated the viability of a military strategy against Iran’s regional ambitions. Hazony outlined three key coalitions shaping the Middle East. The first is Iran’s axis, comprising Iraq, Yemen, Hamas, and Hezbollah. The second is led by Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who aims to resurrect the Ottoman Empire and establish a Sunni caliphate, supported by Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood. Hazony stressed Erdoğan’s antagonism toward pro-Western Gulf monarchies, highlighting his ambitions to control Mecca, Gulf oil wealth, and Jerusalem. The third coalition consists of Israel and moderate Arab regimes in the Gulf, united against both Iranian expansionism and Erdoğan’s Islamist aspirations. Hazony warned that Iran’s decline could inadvertently empower Erdoğan, whose ambitions pose a significant threat to regional stability and could embolden Muslim Brotherhood movements globally, including in Europe and the U.S. Both commentators underscored the high stakes of this geopolitical struggle, cautioning against leaving a power vacuum that could enable authoritarian or Islamist forces to dominate the region.  Part Two:  In their conversation, Steve Bannon and Cynthia Hughes passionately discussed the plight of January 6th detainees and broader issues of governmental “weaponization.” Hughes noted that President Trump, channeling the frustration of advocates like herself and others, has committed to providing immediate relief for these detainees upon taking office, though achieving this will face resistance in Congress. Hughes highlighted the dire circumstances faced by nearly 350 individuals jailed for their roles in the January 6th events. Many have endured nearly four years in prison, faced exorbitant legal costs, and suffered irreparable personal losses, such as broken marriages and estranged families. She detailed the case of Julian Khater, who, despite his prolonged imprisonment and harsh treatment, remains emblematic of what many detainees endure. Hughes stressed that systemic mistreatment in prison, including torturous conditions, cannot go unaccounted for. Bannon echoed this sentiment, calling for justice and accountability for those who orchestrated and allowed such treatment. He emphasized the moral obligation to prevent such abuses from recurring, tying this responsibility to America’s constitutional principles and revolutionary heritage. Both underscored the necessity of pardons but acknowledged that many detainees also face extensive civil litigation, requiring sustained support. Hughes also described her group’s ongoing efforts to provide legal, financial, and emotional assistance to detainees and their families, particularly during the holiday season, as many families face their fourth Christmas apart. They stressed the need for broader public awareness and action to combat governmental overreach and restore justice.  In their conversation, Steve Bannon and Nicole Nogrady reflected on the inspiration behind her song, Modern Day Holy War, which stemmed from the devastating fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in 2019. NoGrady recalled watching the flames consume the historic landmark, describing the moment as a “lightning strike” of divine inspiration. The phrase “modern day holy war” came to her almost instantly, prompting her to begin crafting the song, though the process of writing and producing it took years to complete. NoGrady noted the significance of the song’s release, which coincided with the one-year anniversary of its debut on Bannon’s show and the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral five years after the fire. She described the timing as divinely orchestrated, aligning with global events and themes of religious and cultural struggle. Bannon expanded on the broader context of modern-day holy wars, referencing historical and ongoing conflicts in regions like Syria, the re-emergence of Turkish ambitions for an Ottoman revival, and tensions involving Persian Islamic supremacy. He framed these struggles as reflective of a spiritual battle tied to the birthplace of Christianity, especially poignant during the Christmas season. To conclude the discussion, Bannon praised NoGrady’s work, emphasizing its spiritual and cultural resonance. The segment closed with the full airing of Modern Day Holy War to mark its anniversary, underscoring its enduring message of faith and resilience.  </div>
