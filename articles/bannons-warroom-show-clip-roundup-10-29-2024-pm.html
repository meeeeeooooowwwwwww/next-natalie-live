    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 10/29/2024 [PM]</h1>
    <div>Gavin Wax and Steve Bannon discussed the Trump campaign’s momentum and New York City’s strategic role in the 2024 election. Wax observed a noticeable lack of energy from the left in NYC, describing a "defeatism going through the ranks” compared to past years of vocal opposition, which he sees as a shift in favor of the populist right. Wax and Bannon believe Trump’s focus on winning over diverse, working-class demographics—including Black and Hispanic voters—is resonating well, especially with his New York energy and style. Wax notes that Trump’s appeal goes beyond policy, connecting with low-propensity voters who have felt overlooked by traditional GOP outreach. Highlighting the New York Young Republicans Club’s role in these efforts, Wax shared their extensive grassroots activities, like door-knocking and phone banking across NYC and swing counties, which he believes are vital to expanding populism’s influence. The conversation concluded with excitement about their upcoming gala, which Wax called "the event of the year,” aiming to celebrate populism and build support for the ongoing political movement. TICKETS  Eric Metaxas, with Steve Bannon, expressed strong dissatisfaction with the media’s hostile treatment of Bannon. Metaxas shared his shock at the overt disdain journalists showed, stating, “The level of hostility was utterly despicable.” He described the media as “pampered perfumed fools,” noting they acted more like “the information Warfare Department of the political class” rather than impartial truth-seekers. Bannon and Metaxas agreed that mainstream journalists no longer seek objectivity, calling it a display of contempt for Americans and “team reality.” Bannon remarked that such media hostility reflects the broader, combative state of American politics, which he labeled a "blood sport.” Metaxas, a Yale classmate of Wolf’s, noted his disillusionment, saying he avoids journalists as they "disgust [him] so profoundly.” Despite this, he observed the experience was “horrifying” and emblematic of the societal divide, as he, Bannon, and Wolf—former ideological opposites—have united in pursuit of “what is real and what is true.”  Steve Bannon and Naomi Wolf explored populist themes, personal freedoms, and political unity, challenging the usual labels applied to populist movements. Bannon argued that populism represents a diverse America, with people across races and religions engaging, despite attempts to label these gatherings as “fascist.” Wolf, recalling her own experience, said Bannon’s platform allowed her to warn the public about potential health risks associated with the mRNA vaccine, despite censorship she faced. "Instead of helping women protect their fertility, they lifted [my warnings] out to silence me,” she said, adding that Bannon’s audience provided essential support. Wolf praised Trump for building what she described as a “unity party,” aligning with figures like RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, and Elon Musk, emphasizing that Trump’s coalition now speaks to concerns across demographics: “black people, white people, Hispanic people, women, men.” She also acknowledged Bannon’s role in producing the “Pfizer Papers,” a report revealing alleged vaccine harms, which Wolf says was key in sharing information the government wanted hidden. Bannon emphasized the importance of grassroots support, particularly as November approaches, with projects like Daily Clout providing tools for voter transparency. He also mentioned that Wolf’s work has become integral to his campaign, even accessible to inmates at his correctional facility. Wolf urged continued support, highlighting the role of platforms like War Room in "moving the needle.”  Natalie Winters summarized Steve Bannon’s Press conference earlier on Tuesday.  You can read our coverage of that press conference:  Bannon’s Out, and He’s Not Backing Down: "Dems are Going to Fight Dirty and MAGA Won’t be Silenced”   Monica Crowley talked about the loss of hope in the Population after seeing the Biden-Harris administration in action and said that she believed more and more people were discovering that they saw renewed hope for their situation in President Trump.  Maureen Bannon talks about her Dad being in prison and gives updates on how he taught classes in civics.  </div>
