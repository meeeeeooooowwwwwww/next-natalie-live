    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 11/22/2024 [AM]</h1>
    <div>Steve Bannon commented on the growing pressure from the left-wing Democrats and Wall Street figures like Mark Rowan regarding the Trump administration’s Treasury situation. Bannon emphasized the centrality of the Treasury role in implementing President Trump’s economic program, which he views as crucial to revitalizing the country. He stated that the Treasury is perhaps even more important than the Attorney General in advancing Trump’s economic policies, which many supporters rallied behind. However, Bannon raised concerns about Mark Rowan, the head of Apollo, a major Wall Street firm, saying that figures like him—representing "predatory capitalism”—may not align with Trump’s vision. He criticized the practice of outsourcing jobs to China for cheaper labor, which he sees as detrimental to American interests. Bannon suggested that if Trump were to bring people like Rowan into his administration, it would undermine the economic revival he aims to achieve. He jokingly compared it to bringing in figures like Larry Fink or Leon Black, who represent the same establishment interests. Bannon also pointed out that the transition team is still deliberating, as evidenced by Trump’s lack of firm decisions, and expressed frustration with the way Fox News was downplaying issues related to the transition. He noted that the edge that Representative Matt Gaetz brought to the conversation was missing, and the transition team needed to "reboot” and find fresh momentum with strong nominees. According to Bannon, Gaetz had been the "tip of the spear,” driving the narrative and pushing back against establishment forces.  Jack Posobiec and Steve Bannon engaged in a fiery discussion about the FBI’s current state, its leadership challenges, and the role of figures like Kash Patel and Mike Rogers. Both agreed that the FBI has strayed from its original mission due to cultural and political rot at its senior levels, emphasizing the need for a thorough overhaul. Bannon criticized the public integrity unit for politicizing justice and called for purging leadership to restore the FBI’s credibility. He highlighted Trump’s vision of appointing leaders committed to reform but lamented Senate confirmation challenges. Posobiec and Bannon expressed skepticism about figures like Rogers, alleging his involvement in past controversies like Russiagate and close ties with establishment figures like James Clapper. They accused media outlets, including Fox News, of pushing narratives to undermine the populist-nationalist movement and surround Trump with moderate appointees. The conversation emphasized the divide between rank-and-file FBI agents and its leadership, with Bannon challenging the lack of whistleblowers amidst alleged abuses. He also criticized Fox News and the Murdochs for promoting establishment-friendly narratives, contrasting it with their commitment to dismantling and rebuilding the FBI to better serve Americans. The discussion underscored a broader battle between populist forces and entrenched establishment players, with Bannon framing the struggle as critical to preserving the MAGA agenda. Both concluded with a call for vigilance and action, underscoring their commitment to challenging perceived corruption and systemic failures within the U.S. government.  In a heated conversation, Steve Bannon and Jeff Clark discuss their skepticism about being convicted in Washington D.C. courts, criticizing the jury pool, which they view as biased towards progressive left-wing government employees. Bannon argues that the D.C. judiciary, particularly the district and circuit judges, is corrupt and should be reformed. He stresses the importance of legal defense and warns that those involved in high-profile cases, like Rudy Giuliani, have faced financial ruin due to expensive legal battles. Both Bannon and Clark advocate for a deep structural overhaul of government institutions, particularly the FBI, which they claim is politically biased against conservatives and populists. They argue that the FBI’s influence has grown unchecked, with power consolidating among career bureaucrats rather than elected officials, undermining the Constitutional separation of powers. Clark emphasizes the need for a unified executive branch with the president in full control, rather than a fractured system where unelected bureaucrats exert undue influence. He critiques the rise of the “administrative state,” which has evolved since the Progressive Era, and warns against proposals to put parts of the FBI under dual supervision, arguing this would only exacerbate the issue. They both express a desire to dismantle this “deep state” and restore accountability to government agencies, comparing their efforts to the fall of empires like Carthage. Bannon concludes by highlighting the fight against a system that they believe undermines democratic values and accountability.  In a this conversation between Steve Bannon and Natalie Winters, the discussion centered on a significant legal victory for President Trump, which was a temporary win in New York. Bannon highlighted that while this ruling is a victory for Trump, it’s essential to recognize that the left-wing legal apparatus, led by figures like Norm Eisen, is already preparing to continue its efforts. Winters pointed out that even though Trump’s team has won this round, the lawfare strategy against him remains relentless, with a focus on accountability for what they see as political attacks. Bannon emphasized the danger of the lawfare apparatus, which he views as a significant threat to American democracy. He noted that the “Resistance” movement, including individuals like Jamie Raskin and Jerry Nadler, are jockeying for power in Congress, signaling that the left’s push to undermine Trump and his supporters is far from over. According to Bannon, these attacks are aimed at a long-term strategy to eliminate political opposition and protect a system that works against conservative ideals. The conversation also brought attention to Eisen’s group, the States United Democracy Center, which has been involved in pushing election integrity measures aligned with the left-wing agenda. Winters revealed that this group circulated a memo to the Arizona Attorney General’s office, pushing for actions that align with their broader efforts to disrupt conservative movements and ensure that power remains with the political establishment. Bannon’s tone was clear: while victories like these may seem significant, the lawfare effort will continue unabated until there is accountability for those responsible. </div>
