    <h1>Natalie Winters: Republican Investigations by the 118th Congress Will Uncover All Compromised Individuals In The United States’ Government</h1>
    <div>“War Room” executive editor Natalie Winters talks to host Steve Bannon about the agenda of the new GOP-controlled House of Representatives. “I think that these investigations — whether it is the origin of Covid, the NIH’s role in gain of function research, Hunter Biden, Afghanistan, the list really does go on — I think this is our prime opportunity to really get to the bottom of the central question, which not only are we seeing on full display right now when it comes to the counting of election results, but is the Biden regime… fueled by incompetence or malfeasance?”  </div>
