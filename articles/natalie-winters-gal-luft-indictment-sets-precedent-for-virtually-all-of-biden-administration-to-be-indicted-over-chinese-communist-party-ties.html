    <h1>Natalie Winters: Gal Luft Indictment Sets Precedent For Virtually All Of Biden Administration To Be Indicted Over Chinese Communist Party Ties.</h1>
    <div>Natalie Winters co-host of War Room joins Steve Bannon to break down the indictment of Biden whistleblower Dr. Gal Luft. The timing of Dr. Luft’s indictment following revealing Biden family criminal behavior follows a patten of judicial weaponization to shield the Biden Family. Winters calls the indictment "a classic case of accusing your enemy of what you are guilty of” as Luft is accused of failing to register as a foreign agent for work with China. The indictment cites Dr. Luft’s work with CEFC the same energy company the Biden family has been accused of laundering money through. </div>
