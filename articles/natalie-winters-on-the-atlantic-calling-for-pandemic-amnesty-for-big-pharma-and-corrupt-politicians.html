    <h1>Natalie Winters On The Atlantic Calling For Pandemic Amnesty For Big Pharma And Corrupt Politicians</h1>
    <div>Natalie Winters talks about the Atlantic magazine article that says “Let’s Declare a Pandemic Amnesty,” as a way to forgive and forget the horrid decision-making of U.S. politicians whose policies destroyed the economy, ravaged children’s education and killed some thousands of innocent victims. “It kind of represents the establishment coming to terms with the fact that there are going to be investigations held by Republicans when we take back the House and Senate… There’s an italicized part of the article … where the author really encapsulated what she’s trying to get across with the piece. And she says, ‘We didn’t know’ and she’s talking about the efficacy of masks with children, and I think that just stands at such odds with the slogan of ‘Trust the Experts” and ‘Trust the Science’ that have been beaten down our threats for years…. These so-called experts were never really experts from the beginning.”  </div>
