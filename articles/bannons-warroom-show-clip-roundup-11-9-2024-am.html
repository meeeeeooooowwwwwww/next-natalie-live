    <h1>Bannon’s WarRoom, Show Clip Roundup 11/9/2024 [AM]</h1>
    <div>In his commentary with Natalie Winters, Steve Bannon critiques mainstream media, particularly MSNBC, for allegedly ignoring the influence of a broad coalition of supporters and advisors behind the success of populist movements. He mentions prominent figures such as Bill Ackman and David Sacks, while emphasizing the importance of precision and clear messaging in countering what he sees as misinformation from the left. Bannon advocates for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate alleged wrongdoing and outlines ambitious goals for immigration reform, including mass deportations, to reshape U.S. demographics and political power. Bannon views growing Hispanic support as a key to building a durable political majority, likening it to the realignment seen in the 1930s. He discusses a “reckoning” for federal bureaucracies, a focus on states’ rights, and anticipates intense political battles against Democratic governors and state officials who oppose Trump’s policies. He forecasts a 2028 Democratic primary marked by high-profile governors, signaling a significant cultural resistance. Bannon predicts gender issues will increasingly overshadow racial issues, driven by a cultural shift against traditional power structures, which he believes will define future populist and nationalist debates. Part One:  Part Two:  Part Three:  Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec discussed a cultural struggle they see as a deeper fight than politics. They describe it as a battle between a "radical, Bolshevik, atheistic” worldview versus a Christian-Western foundation, with implications for societies beyond the U.S., including East Asian countries. Bannon argues that traditional values are under attack, citing trends in South Korea, China, and Japan where family and cultural traditions are weakening. Posobiec points out that these shifts mirror the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao promoted the "Four No’s” (no old ideas, culture, customs, or habits), viewing current cultural shifts on social media, especially TikTok, as similar. They highlight a new "4V” trend in South Korea as a reaction to this, where women reject modern norms in favor of traditional roles. Posobiec sees a cultural shift in the U.S. as well, with young women increasingly supporting populist ideas and Trump, reflected in polls showing an 11-point shift among women under 30 toward Trump since August. They connect this trend to a "bro culture” influence, where women align with traditional values and assertive male figures. Bannon sees this as part of a larger societal pushback against modern liberalism and a return to traditionalism, reinforced by media and cultural symbols. Posobiec also discusses several political issues, including the ongoing election battles in Pennsylvania and Arizona. He criticizes Bob Casey, the Pennsylvania senator, for his silence amid allegations of voter fraud, such as unverified ballots and signature discrepancies, calling out the incompetence and corruption surrounding these processes. Posobiec also mocks Casey’s efforts to appear active by tweeting about ballot counting, suggesting he should look for work at McDonald’s in Pennsylvania due to his lack of significant achievements. Turning to Arizona, Posobiec highlights the controversial and slow vote counting in Maricopa County, where large discrepancies in vote totals have raised concerns about transparency and integrity. He emphasizes the need for proper ballot chain-of-custody and ensures that volunteers working tirelessly for the election are recognized, particularly through organizations like Turning Point Action. Posobiec stresses the importance of securing a victory for Carrie Lake in the Senate and achieving a majority in the U.S. Senate, which he believes will strengthen President Trump’s political agenda. He encourages supporters to get involved, whether physically or virtually, to help safeguard election integrity and ensure Republican success.  Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon discuss the need for a special counsel to address ongoing corruption and legal issues, particularly around the mishandling of the Trump case. Giuliani, who has extensive knowledge of the situation, expresses willingness to assist in any investigation, emphasizing that the case is a miscarriage of justice and could set a dangerous precedent if not properly addressed. He criticizes former prosecutor Trey Gowdy, calling him ineffective and accusing him of failing to act during key moments in the investigation. Giuliani also raises questions about Gowdy’s mysterious departure from Congress, suggesting a possible connection to his lack of action. Giuliani also shares his personal legal struggles, detailing his ongoing battle with the 145 million dollar judgment and his claims of being unfairly treated by the justice system. He explains that key evidence, such as video recordings, has been altered or removed to deceive the court, and that his financial accounts and assets have been frozen, leaving him in dire circumstances. He argues that the case against him is a setup, orchestrated by powerful figures involved in corruption, including ties to Ukraine, and claims that ordinary people wouldn’t face such harsh treatment. Giuliani underscores the injustice of his situation, as well as the broader corruption at play. </div>
