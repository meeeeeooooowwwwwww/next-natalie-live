Step-by-Step Solution
To make your project work both locally and on Cloudflare Pages, we need to:
Fix the invalid feed export in the API route.

Ensure JSON file access works consistently across environments.

Test and validate the changes.

1. Fix the API Route (src/app/api/natalie-videos/route.ts)
Since the error explicitly mentions "feed" is not a valid Route export field, your route file likely has an export like this:
typescript

export const feed = async () => {
  // Logic to fetch JSON data
};

Next.js Route Handlers (in the App Router) require exports to be HTTP method names (GET, POST, etc.). Let’s assume this route is meant to serve JSON data when requested (e.g., via a GET request). Update it to:
typescript

// src/app/api/natalie-videos/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { promises as fs } from "fs"; // Node.js fs for reading files
import path from "path";

// Define the path to your JSON file (relative to project root)
const jsonFilePath = path.join(process.cwd(), "data", "natalie-videos.json");

export async function GET() {
  try {
    // Read the JSON file
    const fileContents = await fs.readFile(jsonFilePath, "utf-8");
    const data = JSON.parse(fileContents);
    
    // Return the data as a JSON response
    return NextResponse.json(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error reading JSON file:", error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "Failed to load video data" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}

Key Changes:
Replaced feed with GET to match Next.js Route Handler requirements.

Used process.cwd() to dynamically resolve the file path, ensuring it works in both local and Cloudflare environments.

Added error handling for robustness.

Assumptions:
Your JSON file is located at data/natalie-videos.json in your project. Adjust the jsonFilePath if it’s somewhere else (e.g., public/data/natalie-videos.json).

2. Ensure JSON File Access Works Across Environments
Cloudflare Pages builds your Next.js app in a serverless environment, and file system access can differ from local development. Here’s how to handle JSON data:
Store JSON in the Project: Place your JSON files in a directory like data/ or public/.
data/ (private): Use fs to read it in API routes or getServerSideProps/getStaticProps.

public/ (publicly accessible): Fetch it via HTTP (e.g., /data/natalie-videos.json) in client-side code or API routes.

Dynamic Path Resolution: process.cwd() ensures the file path is resolved relative to the working directory, which works in both local and Cloudflare builds.

Include Files in Build: Ensure your JSON files are committed to GitHub and not ignored by .gitignore. Cloudflare Pages only has access to what’s in your repository.

If your JSON is in public/, you could alternatively fetch it like this:
typescript

// src/app/api/natalie-videos/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function GET() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/data/natalie-videos.json`);
    const data = await response.json();
    return NextResponse.json(data);
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Failed to load video data" }, { status: 500 });
  }
}

Set NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL in your .env file (e.g., http://localhost:3000 locally and your Cloudflare domain in production).
3. Test Locally
Run these commands to verify:
bash

npm run build  # Should complete without errors
npm run start  # Test the production build locally

Then, test the API route:
Open http://localhost:3000/api/natalie-videos in your browser or use curl.

Confirm it returns the expected JSON data.

4. Deploy to Cloudflare
