# Rumble Video Embedding Issue Analysis

## Issue Overview
We're experiencing an issue where Rumble videos won't display properly when embedded in our Next.js application, despite the same embed code working perfectly in a standalone HTML test page.

## Current Setup

### What Works
- **Test HTML page** (http://127.0.0.1:5500/rumble-test.html): Videos load and display correctly with this simple HTML code:
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
      <title>Rumble Embed Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <h1>Rumble Embed Test</h1>
      <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;">
          <iframe 
              src="https://rumble.com/embed/v6oa3ic/?pub=4kxtac" 
              style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%;" 
              frameborder="0" 
              allowfullscreen
          ></iframe>
      </div>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

### What Doesn't Work
- **Next.js Application** (http://localhost:3002/videos/v6qi07w): The same embed code structure fails to display videos when implemented in our Next.js application.

### Embed URL Format
We're using the correct Rumble embed URL format:
```
https://rumble.com/embed/v6qi07w/?pub=4kxtac
```

The format is consistent with successful embeds seen on other sites and in our test HTML.

## Attempted Solutions

1. **Multiple Embedding Approaches**:
   - Direct iframe with proper ref
   - Dynamic script insertion via DOM
   - Next.js Script component with "afterInteractive" strategy

2. **Content Security Policy Updates**:
   - Updated CSP in next.config.js to be more permissive for Rumble:
   ```javascript
   value: `
     default-src 'self';
     script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://rumble.com;
     style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
     img-src 'self' https://1a-1791.com https://rumble.com data:;
     font-src 'self';
     object-src 'none';
     base-uri 'self';
     form-action 'self';
     frame-ancestors 'self';
     frame-src 'self' https://rumble.com;
     connect-src 'self' https://rumble.com;
     media-src 'self' https://rumble.com;
   `
   ```

3. **Different Implementation Methods**:
   - React useRef approach
   - dangerouslySetInnerHTML
   - Direct DOM manipulation
   - Next.js Script component

## Analysis of Potential Issues

1. **Cross-Origin Restrictions**:
   - The fact that the embed works on a test HTML page (127.0.0.1:5500) but not in Next.js (localhost:3002) suggests there may be domain-specific issues.
   - Rumble might be restricting embeds based on specific origins or protocols.

2. **Content Security Policy**:
   - Despite our CSP updates, Next.js may be applying additional security policies.
   - There could be conflicts between our CSP and Next.js's internal handling.

3. **Client-Side Rendering**:
   - Next.js's hydration process might be interfering with the way Rumble's embed script initializes.
   - The Next.js component lifecycle might not align with when Rumble expects to initialize its player.

4. **Server-Side Rendering**:
   - Next.js's SSR might be causing issues with the dynamic content from Rumble.
   - The iframe might load before the component is fully rendered in the client.

5. **Network/CORS Issues**:
   - The requests might be blocked by CORS policies when coming from the Next.js application.
   - Browser security settings may be treating the requests differently.

## Request for Further Suggestions

1. Has anyone successfully embedded Rumble videos in a Next.js application? If so, what approach worked?

2. Are there specific Next.js settings beyond CSP that might be blocking the embed?

3. Would transitioning to a static HTML approach within Next.js (using getStaticProps/getServerSideProps) potentially resolve the issue?

4. Are there alternative embedding methods provided by Rumble that might work better with Next.js?

5. Could the issue be related to how Next.js handles iframes in general rather than specifically Rumble embeds?

6. Should we consider a different approach, such as using an API to get the video content directly?

## Next Steps

1. Check browser console for specific errors related to the embed.

2. Try a completely static approach (static HTML export from Next.js).

3. Contact Rumble support to inquire about known issues with Next.js or React applications.

4. Test with other video embedding platforms to see if the issue is specific to Rumble or a more general embedding problem.

5. Consider implementing a server-side proxy for the embed content if cross-origin issues are confirmed.

Any feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreciated as we continue to troubleshoot this issue.
